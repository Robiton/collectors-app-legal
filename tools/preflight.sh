# Purpose:  One command, run after `git commit` and before `git push`, that runs what CI runs.
# Changelog:
#   2026-09-04 v0.42.2.20260904.0624 — a shipped TEMPLATE naming a `../` sibling must be stripped by the adoption
#                        guide (#302). ai/BACKLOG.md carries scaffold:session-log pointing at
#                        ../ai-project-scaffold-dev and SHOULD — our log really is there. The
#                        defect was that it TRAVELLED: setup.sh strips it, the guide's manual
#                        path (the only route for existing code) did not, and every manual
#                        adoption hard-failed session_currency exit 4 on its first preflight.
#   2026-09-03 v0.42.1.20260903.1914 — the adoption-manifest gate uses the CANONICAL is_upstream_repo signals.
#                        Its first draft invented a fourth spelling and --selftest's drift pin
#                        caught it in one run, which is the pin doing precisely its job.
#   2026-09-03 v0.42.0.20260903.1906 — TWO GATES FOR THE ADOPTION DEFECTS NOTHING HERE COULD SEE (#291, #293, #294).
#                       `adoption manifest` runs tools/adoption_manifest.sh --check: the four
#                       restatements of what an adoption receives had all drifted at once and
#                       no gate compared them. `shipped ai/ file kind` requires every shipped
#                       ai/*.md to declare `template` or `reference`, and a reference file to
#                       say so to a human — ai/PROVENANCE.md and ai/STANDARDS_EVIDENCE.md
#                       shipped as our own engineering notes and the existing templates gate
#                       covered neither, because it checks three named files for dated
#                       headings. A grep for `ai-project-scaffold` would have missed
#                       STANDARDS_EVIDENCE.md entirely, whose self-reference is the phrase
#                       "this repository" — the correlate, not the property. Both gates are
#                       upstream-only: they are rules about what WE ship.
#   2026-09-01 v0.41.0.20260901.1656 — A DECLARED GAP STOPS READING AS A FIRING HOOK (#275).
#                        This file ran `session_hook.sh --closeout >/dev/null 2>&1` and then
#                        printed "wired AND the last start was recorded as HOOK_RAN" for
#                        every exit 0. `closeout` returns 0 for TWO states, and one of them
#                        is the opposite of that sentence: a repository declaring
#                        `<!-- scaffold:hooks-unavailable ... -->` has NO hook records at all
#                        and exits 0 BECAUSE the gap is declared. Preflight reported the
#                        escape hatch as a healthy hook, in green -- a verdict stronger than
#                        its evidence, which is the one thing this file exists to prevent.
#                        The closeout's own words are printed now, and the declared case has
#                        its own verdict line naming the reason.
#                        AND the localcoder budget ADVISORY prints WHICH sections are over
#                        it. The number was in the message and the actionable half was in
#                        stdout, which went to /dev/null (#277).
#                        AND `note`, a new verdict class, whose first subject is: how much
#                        delegable python landed with no draft row (localcoder#201).
#                        A NEW VERDICT CLASS THAT CANNOT FAIL. `note` touches neither PASSED,
#                        FAILED nor GAPS. It exists because the delegation share must be
#                        VISIBLE before it is enforceable: a threshold set from an opinion
#                        rather than from fleet data teaches people to route around the gate,
#                        which is this file's own most-repeated lesson.
#                        MEASURED 2026-09-01: 576 delegable lines in Robiton/localcoder and
#                        278 here in one week, 0 drafted in both, every report green. The
#                        share is the first check here whose denominator comes from git
#                        rather than from a log somebody has to remember to write.
#                        EXIT 3 IS PRINTED, NOT SWALLOWED. "No draft log here" is the right
#                        answer for an adopter with no localcoder, and it renders as that
#                        sentence rather than as silence or as a clean 0%.
#   2026-09-01 v0.40.0.20260901.0845 — THE VERDICT NOW NAMES THE COMMIT IT IS ABOUT, which
#                        is what makes the pre-push hook cheap enough to leave installed.
#                        The run log said `preflight:preflight ok 46 gate(s)` and nothing
#                        about WHAT was gated, so a pass from four commits ago was
#                        indistinguishable from the one you just ran -- and the hook
#                        therefore re-ran the entire ~173s gate to learn something this
#                        script had recorded seconds earlier. A hook that costs three
#                        minutes per push is one people uninstall, or route around until
#                        --no-verify is reflex; on this machine that is exactly what
#                        happened, and an adopter independently reported the shape it
#                        leaves: `preflight ; push` typed with a SEMICOLON, so the gate ran,
#                        FAILED, and the push went through anyway.
#                        Four cases run the REAL hook file against fixtures. The fourth is
#                        the one that matters: a stale PASS followed by a FAIL must not
#                        shortcut, because reading the newest PASS rather than the newest
#                        VERDICT would skip straight past the failure after it -- rebuilding
#                        the defect inside the guard. Mutation-verified both ways.
#   2026-09-01 v0.39.0.20260901.0531 — THE BURST MESSAGE NAMED ONE COMMAND FOR THREE FILES.
#                        --apply rotates SESSION.md and deliberately does not touch
#                        MEMORY.md -- ai/STANDARDS.md forbids auto-rotating it, because
#                        deciding which lines of a decision are load-bearing is judgement.
#                        So the new burst gate added in 0.38.0 sent people to a tool that
#                        correctly does nothing for the file they were sent about, and which
#                        until session_archive.py 0.17.0 then told them everything was
#                        already archived. A gate is only as good as the remedy it names.
#   2026-09-01 v0.38.0.20260901.0435 — THE ARCHIVE CEILINGS ARE A GATE NOW, AND A HOOK THAT
#                        NEVER FIRED IS A FAILURE (#265, #264).
#                        #265: the label said "archive ceilings" and nothing gated them.
#                        session_archive.py has shipped --exit-status since 0.11.0,
#                        documented as "so a caller can branch on the RESULT instead of
#                        grepping this tool's prose" -- and its only caller was setup.sh's
#                        ADVISORY block, so [PASS] printed over a breached ceiling under a
#                        label naming that ceiling. The shape 1b-vii catches is a --check
#                        nobody calls; this is one level out, a --check whose only caller
#                        cannot fail. OVER stays advisory -- 0.14.0 argued out failing on
#                        file length and that still holds -- but PAST THE BURST LINE fails,
#                        because the tool's own words for it are "a trim that stopped
#                        happening, not 'a bit over'". Three cases, since a fix failing on
#                        both would recreate what 0.14.0 removed and one failing on neither
#                        is what was reported. archive_gate() is split out so the branch is
#                        testable without owning an over-the-line repository.
#                        #264: an adopter found two repos, four days, 1333 logged rows and
#                        ZERO session_hook:start -- reported as an advisory GAP, exit 0, so a
#                        repository where no hook had ever run went green. --closeout asks
#                        about the MOST RECENT start, the right question for "did it work
#                        this session" and the wrong one for "has this client ever called
#                        us". Escalated only when the log PROVES the repo has been worked in
#                        (50+ rows from other tools, still no start); a fresh adoption
#                        returns 3, because reddening there is the hazard 0.58.0 shipped.
#   2026-09-01 v0.37.0.20260901.0419 — THE DECLARED MUST-RUN GATES DID NOT RUN ON A RED RUN
#                        (#259). They sat below the first `if [ -n "$FAILED" ]; then ...
#                        return 1`, so whenever any other gate had already failed, the
#                        adopter's own declared suite was skipped -- and not listed under
#                        DID NOT RUN either, because GAPS is only appended by the skip
#                        helpers and these never reached one. The condition under which you
#                        most want the product suite was the condition that dropped it, and
#                        AGENTS.md says plainly that a declared gate which does not run is a
#                        FAILURE whatever the reason. The reason was our own control flow.
#                        FOURTH DISTINCT FAILURE OF THIS ONE MECHANISM: never called; called
#                        after the only $FAILED check; verdict discarded; and now not reached
#                        on a red run. Each earlier fix was pinned by a case that could not
#                        see the next layer, so this one asserts the ORDERING -- must_gate
#                        must appear before the first failure return -- which is the property
#                        all three previous cases lacked.
#                        AND THE COVERAGE CLAIM IS CONDITIONAL NOW. "your project's own test
#                        suite -- run it separately" printed unconditionally, which is simply
#                        false in a repo declaring scaffold:must-run, and read as if the
#                        omission were deliberate on exactly the runs where the gates had
#                        been silently dropped.
#                        "DID NOT RUN on this machine" IS NO LONGER THE HEADING (#258). A
#                        missing ruff is a machine gap; session_currency on a repo that never
#                        tags is a REPOSITORY gap that no installation will ever close. Both
#                        printed under one heading that asserted the first cause.
#   2026-09-01 v0.36.0.20260901.0345 — "EVERYTHING CI WILL RUN" WAS FALSE ABOUT THIS FILE'S OWN
#                        SUITE, AND HAD BEEN FOR THREE RECORDED FAILURES. CI discovers every
#                        tools/*.sh advertising --selftest and runs it, preflight.sh
#                        included; preflight excluded ITSELF to avoid recursing. So the cases
#                        policing preflight ran only after a push. That produced a
#                        local-green/CI-red three times -- the must-run declaration case, the
#                        session_currency wiring, and on 2026-09-01 the CI-only assertion
#                        case, on the very commit adding a matrix leg -- each documented at
#                        the site that hit it, none closing the hole. Documented at three
#                        sites and closed at none is not a known limitation.
#                        THE EXCLUSION WAS LOAD-BEARING AND THE FIRST FIX WAS A FORK BOMB.
#                        selftest() copies this file into a fixture and runs THE MAIN FLOW,
#                        so main -> selftest -> main is unbounded. The gate shipped with a
#                        comment asserting recursion was impossible and forked 207 processes
#                        before being killed by hand. SCAFFOLD_PREFLIGHT_INNER bounds it at
#                        depth 2, and it is EXPORTED AT THE --selftest DISPATCH, not only at
#                        the gate: CI enters through --selftest directly, where a
#                        gate-only marker is never set, so the laptop would have been fine
#                        and the runner would have hung.
#                        TWO CASES PIN IT, and both took three attempts. The marker case is
#                        live-state, not static. The guard case went: presence anywhere in
#                        the main flow (the dispatch's own export satisfied it), then
#                        adjacency within six lines (the COMMENT EXPLAINING THE GUARD
#                        satisfied it -- the identical defect ci_status.sh fixed the same
#                        day, re-created in another file), and finally adjacency with
#                        comments stripped. A regression here does not look like a red
#                        build; it looks like a runner that stops responding.
#   2026-08-30 v0.35.0.20260830.0600 — NEW GATE: tools/dependency_audit.sh, the one class an
#                        off-the-shelf scanner genuinely owns. Deliberately NOT wired through
#                        gate(), which has two outcomes where this has three -- clean, found,
#                        and DID NOT SCAN. rc 3 prints a GAP. Collapsing that into a pass is
#                        the ci_status defect verbatim: no alerts for months across three
#                        repositories where every alert feature was switched off.
#   2026-08-30 v0.34.2.20260830.0527 — FIX IN v0.34.1: the w15 temp cleanup used $_w15 outside the
#                        OUTER guard that assigns it, so in any repo taking that branch --
#                        i.e. every adoption -- `set -u` raised "unbound variable" and killed
#                        preflight six gates in. Green upstream, fatal downstream: the exact
#                        blast radius this file has been bitten by before. Now ${_w15:-}.
#                        Found by re-running the sweep IN localcoder rather than assuming a
#                        fix verified upstream travels.
#   2026-08-30 v0.34.1.20260830.0025 — SECURITY: the W-15 gate wrote to /tmp/.w15hits, a fixed path
#                        in a world-writable directory. A local user can pre-create it as a
#                        symlink and the `>` redirect truncates whatever it points at, with
#                        this process's privileges; it also collides between concurrent runs,
#                        and CI here is SELF-HOSTED, so /tmp persists between jobs and across
#                        repositories. Now mktemp with a template -- the idiom four other
#                        sites in this file already use. The mktemp is done BEFORE the
#                        if-chain and fails CLOSED: the first draft had it inside the elif,
#                        where a failed mktemp would have printed [PASS] for a check that
#                        never ran.
#   2026-08-30 v0.34.0.20260830.0005 — NEW GATE: the canonical hook set and the hooks we actually
#                        run must agree. setup.sh installs .claude/settings.hooks.json into
#                        every adopter; if it drifts from .claude/settings.json, adopters get
#                        a hook set this repository does not run -- which is what happened
#                        when the set lived in a setup.sh heredoc and decayed to 1 of 6
#                        commands with nothing comparing them. A FAILURE, not a gap: both
#                        files are ours and both are in the tree.
#   2026-08-26 v0.33.0 — provenance_check.sh wired as a non-blocking gate. It ships --check, and
#                        case 1b-vii fails a tool that ships --check with nothing calling it --
#                        caught in CI only, because this script excludes itself from its own
#                        discovery, which is the same local blind spot the session-currency
#                        wiring hit in 0.31.1.
#   2026-08-22 v0.32.0 — A FAILING ROW BURIED IN A LONG SUITE WAS DISCARDED (localcoder#182).
#                        Both failure paths printed `tail -25` of the suite output. For a
#                        173-case suite that is 25 PASS rows and the summary, while the one
#                        `| FAIL` line sits in the middle. Measured 2026-08-22: the localcoder
#                        audit failed inside preflight and passed standalone four times on the
#                        same tree, and the case name was unrecoverable -- so an intermittent
#                        failure, the kind you get one look at, left nothing to diagnose.
#                        salient_then_tail() keeps the lines that look like a diagnosis, IN
#                        EMISSION ORDER with line numbers, and then the tail. Same fix
#                        localcoder's mcp_client.py already carries for the same reason.
#                        Deliberately over-inclusive: a duplicated line costs nothing, a
#                        dropped one costs the diagnosis. Three selftest cases, one of them
#                        asserting the tail SURVIVES -- printing only the salient lines would
#                        trade one blind spot for another.
#   2026-08-19 v0.31.1 — the session-currency wiring was an `echo`, not a gate, and case
#                        1b-vii caught it: selftest-green, unused. Now a real gate() call
#                        with --check passed EXPLICITLY — relying on the default left the
#                        call invisible to the matcher, which is the same defect one level
#                        down. Non-blocking: --check exits 0 even when the record is behind.
#   2026-08-19 v0.31.0 — session currency reported beside the unreleased-commits warning. They
#                        are one question from two ends: that one says a fix nobody can install
#                        exists, this says a release nobody wrote down shipped. Every SESSION.md
#                        reference in this file was TEMPLATE detection and none asked whether it
#                        was CURRENT — so eleven tags shipped through 44 green gates here with
#                        the record a day stale. Advisory, like release_status.
#   2026-08-18 v0.30.0.20260819.0231 — reports whether the session hooks are wired to
#                        tools/session_hook.sh (P0-5). ADVISORY, not a gate: the upgrade
#                        does not touch a developer's client configuration, so this names
#                        the one-command remedy instead of failing on arrival.
#   2026-08-18 v0.26.0.20260818.1827 — A TOOL THAT SHIPS --check MUST BE CALLED IN THAT MODE,
#                        and status_block.sh is why. It shipped in 0.58.0 specifically so a
#                        stale status table would be a GATE RESULT rather than something a
#                        reader has to notice — and for three releases nothing invoked its
#                        --check. Selftest discovery picked the tool up, so it sat green on
#                        its own fixtures while the file it exists to police was never once
#                        compared. Present, tested, pointed at nothing: D-18's shape, in the
#                        cure for D-18's shape.
#                        Two changes, the instance and the class. run_all now gates the block
#                        when the target file declares one (silent when it does not; a GAP
#                        when the markers are there and the generator is not). New selftest
#                        case 1b-vii fails if any tool with a `--check` mode has no preflight
#                        call in that mode and no `scaffold:no-gate <reason>`.
#                        --selftest proves a tool WORKS; only a call in run_all proves it RUNS.
#   2026-08-18 v0.25.0.20260818.1156 — EVERY FAILING ASSERTION IN A WORKFLOW MUST ALSO RUN LOCALLY,
#                        or say why it cannot (P0-2, the class behind the instance). Each
#                        `::error::` now needs `scaffold:also-local <which check>` or
#                        `scaffold:ci-only <why>` within three lines above it. Naming WHICH
#                        is the point: "there is a counterpart somewhere" is the claim that
#                        rotted, and a named one can be followed and falsified. All five in
#                        scaffold-check.yml were verified by hand and annotated -- including
#                        the lost-+x case, which mode_scan.sh catches by reading the mode git
#                        RECORDS rather than the one on disk (core.fileMode=false hides it).
#                        Also: coverage_note for tools/scaffold_version.sh, which --coverage
#                        demanded the moment the workflow started invoking it.
#   2026-08-18 v0.24.0.20260818.0844 — a shipped workflow must not assume a FRESH MACHINE. Every
#                        workflow here was written against GitHub-hosted runners, where each
#                        job gets a new VM; self-hosted runners persist their workspace and
#                        home directory, and the difference is silent until a one-shot step
#                        runs twice. `git remote add mirror` -> `error: remote mirror already
#                        exists`, exit 3, five seconds, on every run after the first. The
#                        mirror had not moved in 36 releases and the reason had silently
#                        changed from a billing block to this, because both present as a red
#                        X on a step no one reads. Looks for the SHAPE, so the next one-shot
#                        operation is caught too; an append guarded by an existence test is
#                        correct and is not flagged.
#   2026-08-18 v0.23.0.20260818.0753 — the archive verdict must be read from an EXIT CODE, not
#                        grepped out of prose. Asserts setup.sh asks session_archive.py for
#                        --exit-status and no longer branches on matching its report, so the
#                        blind spot cannot return by anyone matching one more token.
#   2026-08-18 v0.22.0.20260818.0653 — inside an adoption FIXTURE, the adopter's must-run gates
#                        are skipped and NAMED (#227). adoption_check runs a full inner
#                        preflight in each of two fixtures; in an adopter that declares a
#                        must-run gate that inner preflight was also running the ADOPTER'S
#                        OWN SUITE, and the same suite then ran a third time as the job's own
#                        audit step. Three runs of one suite per push, two of them proving
#                        nothing the third did not.
#                        MEASURED: localcoder's adoption_check 131s -> 66s, which is now the
#                        same as this repo's 62s -- the entire difference between the two was
#                        the declared gate. On the self-hosted M3 the localcoder job had been
#                        CANCELLED at a 5-minute ceiling and then again at 12.
#                        IT IS ALSO THE RIGHT SCOPE, which matters more than the minutes: a
#                        check named "do the SCAFFOLD's gates work in an adoption" should not
#                        fail because the adopter's product test failed. Skipping it makes the
#                        check answer its own question.
#                        NAMED, NEVER SILENT -- the verdict prints the skipped set and why,
#                        because a gate that stops running is what this file exists to catch.
#   2026-08-18 v0.21.0.20260818.0418 — an exception to selftest discovery is now CHECKED (#237).
#                        scaffold-check.yml skips adoption_check.sh in the discovery sweep
#                        because an explicit step already runs it: in that tool `--selftest`
#                        and bare are the same function, so CI ran one identical ~160s twice
#                        and was cancelled at its own 5-minute ceiling BEFORE eleven later
#                        steps -- header checks, required files, the scanners, the localcoder
#                        audit -- ran at all. Reported from the godsfall adoption at 162s+161s.
#                        THE SKIP IS THE INVERSE OF WHAT DISCOVERY EXISTS TO CATCH: not a
#                        suite nobody runs, a suite that runs twice. But delete that explicit
#                        step and the skip silently retires the suite -- the original defect,
#                        reintroduced one level up by its own exception. So it is checked,
#                        not trusted: every basename in SELFTEST_SKIP must appear as an
#                        explicit invocation elsewhere in the same workflow. Fixtures assert
#                        both directions, and the real tree was mutation-verified by deleting
#                        the step (27 passed / 1 failed, naming adoption_check.sh).
#   2026-08-16 v0.20.0.20260816.1916 — the vendored scaffold's freshness is now a GATE.
#                        tools/scaffold_version.sh exits 1 on "behind" and preflight called
#                        it only via --selftest: the check was verified and never run.
#                        Fails at two or more releases behind, reports at one, exit 3 when
#                        upstream is unreachable -- offline must not read as current.
#   2026-08-15 v0.19.1.20260815.0500 — A FAILING MUST-RUN GATE NO LONGER PRINTS UNDER A PASSED LINE. D-18's
#                        shape a THIRD time, one layer deeper than v0.16.0's fix and found the
#                        same way — by a release going out wrong. That fix added the must_gate
#                        CALL and placed it after the only `if [ -n "$FAILED" ]` branch, so from
#                        then until now a declared must-run gate could run, print [FAIL], set
#                        $FAILED, and be followed by PREFLIGHT PASSED. Same trigger as last
#                        time: version-files-agree, `version` 0.39.0 against pyproject 0.38.0.
#                        The tag was cut and published on that PASSED, and it installs under the
#                        old version string. $FAILED is now consulted again after the block.
#   2026-08-15 v0.19.0.20260815.0200 — Report whether a RELEASE is due, advisory and never a failure. A repo
#                        is pushed many times per release, and failing a push for that would
#                        train people to bypass this gate — which is how the prose checklist
#                        in ai/PLANNING.md stopped being read. Measured when someone finally
#                        asked: 9 unreleased product commits here, 26 in Robiton/localcoder.
#   2026-08-13 v0.18.0 — LIVENESS. A SILENT GATE AND A HUNG GATE LOOKED IDENTICAL.
#                        `gate()` captured its command in a command substitution, so nothing
#                        reached the terminal until it finished — fine at one second,
#                        indefensible at the 1,964s `tests/audit_localcoder.sh` measured on
#                        this machine (18s with --offline; eight cases do live model drafts).
#                        For thirty-three minutes preflight printed NOTHING, and three pushes
#                        were killed by people assuming it had wedged. A developer who cannot
#                        tell working from wedged kills it, and a gate that gets killed is a
#                        gate that does not run — this project's central defect arriving
#                        through the user interface instead of the code.
#                        Prints `[..] <label> — still running, 12m04s elapsed` after 20s, then
#                        every 15s on a TTY and every 60s when redirected: enough to prove
#                        liveness in a CI log without burying the verdict.
#                        run_selftests waits out loud too, naming what is RUNNING versus what
#                        is QUEUED behind the throttle — reporting a queued suite as running
#                        would be a lie in the one message whose job is telling the truth
#                        about what is happening.
#   2026-08-12 v0.17.0 — The is_upstream_repo drift pin now greps the WHOLE TRACKED TREE.
#                        Added in 0.36.6 after the drift was found in scaffold-check.yml, it
#                        checked scaffold-check.yml AND NOTHING ELSE — so it never saw
#                        setup.sh, which carried the same drift and was strictly worse. A pin
#                        scoped to the file where a defect was FOUND is scoped to the wrong
#                        thing; same mistake as sweeping *.md for W-15's stale paths.
#   2026-08-12 v0.16.0 — THE MUST-RUN DECLARATION WAS DECORATIVE. MUST_RUN was parsed from
#                        AGENTS.md and NAMED in the verdict under the words "all of which
#                        ran" — printed inside the PASSED branch, so the sentence appeared
#                        precisely when nothing had checked. must_gate() was defined,
#                        documented and covered by three selftest cases, and called from
#                        NOWHERE but those cases.
#                        Measured in Robiton/localcoder: tests/audit_localcoder.sh was
#                        declared must-run and FAILING (pyproject 0.21.0 vs version 0.22.0,
#                        so an install reported the wrong release). preflight printed "all of
#                        which ran" and PASSED; CI caught it after the push, which is the one
#                        thing this script exists to prevent.
#                        D-18's shape inside the mechanism built for D-18. The three cases
#                        were not wrong — they proved must_gate BEHAVES when called. Nothing
#                        proved it IS called, because reachability is not a property a unit
#                        test of the function can have. A case now greps the main flow for
#                        the call, which is the only place that answer lives.
#   2026-08-12 v0.15.1 — A DIRECTORY IS EXECUTABLE. The workflow's second discovery loop
#                        tested `[ -x ]` only, so src/localcoder/__pycache__ passed it and
#                        grep wrote "Is a directory" to stderr on every run. Invisible while
#                        discovery walked only tools/, which has no subdirectories; the very
#                        first product-dir run surfaced it. selftest_tools() here always had
#                        the test — so "the two copies agree" now checks for it, 3 -> 4
#                        signals. A pin that does not cover the thing that drifted is not a
#                        pin, and this drifted within a day of the pin being written.
#   2026-08-12 v0.15.0 — 25 -> 26 gates: tools/stale_path_scan.sh is discovered by the
#                        *_scan.sh convention, so it needed no registration in either CI or
#                        here. The added gate is its selftest. Also: the setup.sh --check
#                        label still promised "localcoder sync", retired in W-15 — surfaced
#                        by the gate's own failure output, which is the machinery working.
#   2026-08-12 v0.14.1 — Two stale W-15 references, both found by a scanner rather than by
#                        reading: the coverage map still carried notes for
#                        tools/audit_localcoder.sh and tools/localcoder_sync.py, and --list
#                        PRINTED "4. tools/audit_localcoder.sh --offline" as a step to run.
#                        An instruction to run a file that is not there.
#   2026-08-12 v0.14.0 — `scaffold:product-dir` — selftest discovery is no longer hardcoded to
#                        tools/. 24 -> 25 gates; the one added is "product dir" (DEC-18 — name
#                        the delta). Robiton/localcoder ships at src/localcoder/ and tools/
#                        there is the vendored governance layer, so scanning tools/ alone left
#                        that repo's own shipped executables as the one thing CI never
#                        selftested. It had been fixing that by EDITING scaffold-check.yml,
#                        which made a PRODUCT file divergent: every upgrade left a sidecar to
#                        reconcile, and three were found tracked since 2026-08-09.
#                        A DECLARED DIR THAT DOES NOT EXIST FAILS. Silently falling back to
#                        tools/ is how a renamed product directory retires a suite with nothing
#                        to notice — D-18, and why scaffold:must-run behaves the same way.
#                        TWO IMPLEMENTATIONS, PINNED. CI's discovery must not depend on the
#                        tool it is discovering, so the workflow has its own copy; --selftest
#                        checks it for the same marker, base and missing-dir treatment. The
#                        is_upstream_repo copies drifted for months and were correct only by
#                        accident; an unpinned duplicate is the defect, not the duplicate.
#   2026-08-12 v0.13.0 — --selftest now pins the WORKFLOW's copies of is_upstream_repo, not
#                        just the two shell ones. The AGENTS.md placeholder step used
#                        `setup.sh` as its third signal — the one file EVERY adopter has, so
#                        strictly weaker than the rule — and never misfired, because no
#                        adopter carries overlays/ either. Correct by accident is how a
#                        drifted duplicate survives, and 1b only ever looked at the shell.
#   2026-08-12 v0.12.0 — NEW GATE: shipped workflows must pin actions at or above a declared
#                        floor. 23 -> 24 gates; the one added is "shipped action floor"
#                        (DEC-18 — name the delta, never just observe a bigger number).
#                        scaffold-check.yml is a PRODUCT_FILE, so its pins run in every
#                        adopting repository: `actions/checkout@v4` put a node20 deprecation
#                        annotation on every run of every adopter, permanently, and one they
#                        could not act on because we chose the pin. That is A10's shape with
#                        a different owner, reported from the godsfall adoption on the day it
#                        first reached zero annotations. A FLOOR, NOT "IS IT LATEST": latest
#                        needs the network and would degrade to a silent pass offline.
#   2026-08-12 v0.11.0 — coverage_note for tools/adoption_check.sh, which CI now invokes. The
#                        coverage gate caught this the moment the workflow step landed,
#                        which is the machinery working: a tool CI runs and this script
#                        does not know about is exactly what it exists to find.
#   2026-08-11 v0.10.0 — THE NO-LOCALCODER-EXECUTION RULE IS SCAFFOLD-ONLY NOW. DEC-20 says
#                        THE SCAFFOLD does not invoke localcoder; an ADOPTER invoking it is
#                        the product working as designed. A pre-write hook, a best-of-N
#                        wrapper and an attribution wrapper all must call the binary, and
#                        this gate told adopters they may not use the thing they installed.
#                        Worse, it fired on the leftovers THE SPLIT ITSELF CREATED: 0.36.x
#                        stops shipping tools/localcoder and friends but deliberately does
#                        not delete them, so the upgrade left the files in place AND added
#                        a gate that failed on them. An upgrade that cannot pass its own
#                        gate immediately after running is the defect.
#                        The matcher was also mention-based: help text, docstrings and
#                        message f-strings counted as invocations. Those are excluded now,
#                        though scoping matters more — upstream has no wrappers, so this
#                        gate is green in every repo we test in and could only ever be seen
#                        from a real adoption.
#                        Reported from the first real 0.36.2 adoption, along with the
#                        context-survival gate failing there for the same reason: a check
#                        about the scaffold's own repository, enforced on everyone.
#   2026-08-11 v0.9.0 — THE LOCALCODER CONTEXT BUDGET IS HARD UPSTREAM AND ADVISORY IN AN
#                        ADOPTION, because 28 IS THIS REPOSITORY'S NUMBER. W-10 set it as a
#                        ratchet at a level this repo had already reached, which makes a
#                        failure here a real result — prose came back. It is not a fact
#                        about anyone else.
#                        An adoption that leans on the local model SHOULD carry more policy
#                        than the scaffold does. Measured on the one that reported this:
#                        localcoder drafted 16.1% of landed code at a 0% correction rate,
#                        off exactly the role-split table and delegation policy this gate
#                        would have told them to delete. Enforcing it downstream inverts
#                        the tool — red on arrival, demanding removal of the thing that was
#                        working — and ai/SECURITY.md's rule is that such a guard gets
#                        ripped out and then protects nothing.
#                        Caught before it reached anyone only because a real 0.36.0 adopter
#                        read the release BEFORE upgrading. The gate is green in every repo
#                        we test in, so nothing here could have found it.
#                        is_upstream_repo's three signals are INLINED rather than sourced —
#                        tools/scaffold_version.sh runs its main flow at top level — and
#                        the duplication is PINNED by a new selftest case asserting the two
#                        definitions still agree. Two copies of one rule is this project's
#                        most repeated defect; if either drifts, an adopter silently gets
#                        the wrong severity.
#   2026-08-11 v0.5.0 — GATES DECLARE MUST-RUN OR MAY-SKIP, PER REPOSITORY (D19, W-22
#                        part three). Every `if [ -x tool ]` guard here falls through to a
#                        gap, and a gap prints above a PASSED line and exits 0. Right for
#                        anything environmental; wrong for the repository's own test suite.
#                        D-18 is the case: forty behavioural cases that had never run in
#                        CI, discovered where they were not, gapped, green for months.
#                        The declaration lives in AGENTS.md, at column 0, because THIS FILE
#                        IS VENDORED and force-installed — a list here would be wrong in one
#                        of the two places by construction and overwritten in the adopter.
#                        Same argument as the divergence markers needing both sides.
#                        NOT AN EXPECTED GATE COUNT, and that was argued rather than
#                        assumed: a count is one number standing in for a set, so two gates
#                        can vanish while one appears and the total is unchanged; every
#                        legitimate environment difference forces a re-baseline nobody
#                        reads; and keyed on a fingerprint it mints a fresh baseline
#                        whenever the fingerprint moves, ending up always correct and never
#                        informative.
#                        NOT-INSTALLED AND NOT-EXECUTABLE NOW PRINT DIFFERENTLY. `[ -x ]`
#                        is false for both, so a lost +x bit and a missing file were
#                        indistinguishable — and the lost bit is likelier and more
#                        confusing, because the file is right there. Measured twice in one
#                        week in this repo: a git apply --reject dropped the +x from
#                        audit_localcoder.sh and preflight ran 24 gates instead of 26 and
#                        still printed PASSED; and localcoder_footprint.py was committed
#                        with git recording 644 despite the on-disk +x. Neither mechanism
#                        subsumes the other — this one catches both of those instantly and
#                        would NOT have caught D-18, where the file is genuinely absent.
#                        The verdict now NAMES the must-run set rather than counting it
#                        (D18): "18 gates, and I could not say which eighteen" is the
#                        sentence that found D-18 after three rounds of reading the gap as
#                        noise.
#   2026-08-10 v0.4.0 — FIND THE ADOPTER'S TEST SUITE, NOT JUST OUR OWN (#D-18). This
#                        script is vendored into every adopting project and searched only
#                        tools/ for the localcoder audit. Robiton/localcoder keeps its
#                        suite in tests/ — correctly, because tools/ there is this
#                        governance layer and its AGENTS.md says the product is src/, ops/,
#                        tests/, templates/. The paths had never matched, the gap printed
#                        above a PASSED line, and that repository had never run its own
#                        40-case suite in CI. A gap is not a failure by design and that
#                        design is right; the defect was that nothing could say which
#                        gates were supposed to have run. See D19 and W-22 part three.
#   2026-08-10 v0.3.0 — EXIT 3 IS A SKIP, NOT A FAILURE AND NOT A PASS (#188). An
#                        adopter's parse checker shelled out to a godot that was not
#                        installed: 'command not found' contains no 'Parse Error', so it
#                        announced '7 file(s) parse cleanly' and three CI runs went green
#                        on zero work. The gate gave its strongest verdict at the moment it
#                        could give none.
#                        gate() now renders 3 as [SKIP] — NOT verified, feeding the GAP
#                        machinery that already existed for this idea on the coverage side.
#                        It does not set the failure flag: a developer without the
#                        toolchain can still push and cannot mistake a skip for a pass.
#                        The bespoke lint_python branch is GONE — it hand-rolled this split
#                        for one tool on its exit 2, and keeping it would be a second
#                        definition of the rule, free to disagree with gate().
#                        The new case asserts all three outcomes at once and fails both
#                        ways a skip can be miscounted: folded into pass (the reported bug)
#                        and folded into fail (which trains people to ignore red).
#   2026-08-09 v0.2.0 — Knows about tools/mode_scan.sh, and needs to: this script's FIRST
#                        pull request landed two new tools at mode 644, their selftests did
#                        not run, and preflight reported both suites passing. It ran them off
#                        the FILESYSTEM mode while git records its own — and with
#                        core.fileMode false, which is correct on a filesystem that reports
#                        0700 for everything, those two numbers disagree by design. The gap
#                        was one this file already NAMED as not covered, which is the least
#                        bad way to be wrong but is still wrong.
#   2026-08-09 v0.1.0 — New (#166). The scaffold shipped several local gates and NO single
#                        command that ran them, so every adopter reconstructed CI's list from
#                        memory and each omitted a different check. Measured on this repo's
#                        own owner, 2026-08-09: two red builds in three minutes, on the
#                        commits that were adding a rule about checking CI. The first was a
#                        stale header; the second was the localcoder drift check, which had
#                        never been run once locally.
#
#                        THE SECOND FAILURE IS THE DESIGN INPUT, NOT THE FIRST. CI stops at
#                        its first failing step, so a red build teaches you about exactly one
#                        gate and hides the next one behind it — fix, push, wait, discover the
#                        next. This runs EVERY gate and reports all of them, so one round trip
#                        replaces N.
#
#                        IT DELEGATES AND DOES NOT REIMPLEMENT. `setup.sh --check` already
#                        runs the scanners, header_check, localcoder_sync and the archive
#                        report; re-running those rules from a second file is how #96 reached
#                        one copy and not the other, twice. What was missing is that nothing
#                        ran the three checks setup.sh --check explicitly NAMES as not
#                        covered, and nothing ran header_check in CI's stricter form.
#
#                        A DIRTY TREE IS A PRECONDITION FAILURE, NOT A WARNING (exit 3).
#                        `header_check --since` reads the COMMITTED diff, so running it with
#                        the change still in the working tree reports clean and proves
#                        nothing — the exact trap that produced two invalid test setups
#                        before a real reproduction. A warning is what gets skimmed past on
#                        the way to a push, so this refuses and says why; --allow-dirty is
#                        one flag away for the case where the dirt is unrelated.

# ==== WHICH COMMIT WAS THE VERDICT ABOUT? ================================================
#
# The run log recorded `preflight:preflight  ok  46 gate(s)` and nothing about WHAT was
# gated, so a pass from an hour and four commits ago is indistinguishable from the one you
# just ran. That gap is why `.githooks/pre-push` had to re-run the whole 173s gate to learn
# something this script already knew a second earlier -- and a hook that costs three minutes

# Run one gate, keep going on failure, remember what broke. NOT `set -e` and not `&&`: the
# whole point is that a push learns about every gate at once, and a chain stops at the first.
# ==== LIVENESS, BECAUSE A SILENT GATE AND A HUNG GATE LOOK IDENTICAL =========================
#
# `gate` captured its command in a command substitution, so nothing reached the terminal until
# the command finished. That is fine at one second and indefensible at thirty-three minutes,
# which is what `tests/audit_localcoder.sh` measured on 2026-08-13: 1,964s for the full suite
# against 18s for `--offline`, because eight cases perform live model drafts.
#
# During those thirty-three minutes preflight printed NOTHING. Three pushes were killed by
# people (and by me) assuming it had hung. A developer who cannot tell "working" from "wedged"
# kills it, and a gate that gets killed is a gate that does not run — which is this project's
# central defect arriving through the user interface rather than through the code.
#
# CADENCE IS SLOWER WHEN NOBODY IS WATCHING. On a TTY a person is waiting and wants to see
# movement; in CI the same output is log noise, so it drops to once a minute — enough to prove
# liveness to whoever reads the log later, not enough to bury the verdict.

# ---- MUST-RUN GATES, DECLARED BY THE REPOSITORY (D19, W-22 part three) ----------------
#
# THE PROBLEM THIS SOLVES. Every `if [ -x tool ]` guard in this file falls through to a
# gap, and a gap prints above a PASSED line and exits 0. That is right for a genuinely
# environmental thing — no Ollama, no godot on this machine — and it is wrong for the
# repository's OWN test suite, which is not optional anywhere. D-18 is the case: localcoder
# had a forty-case suite that had never run in CI, discovered where it was not, gapped, and
# gone green for months. The count was visible; which gates it stood for was not.
#
# WHY THE DECLARATION LIVES IN AGENTS.md AND NOT IN THIS FILE. This script is VENDORED into
# every adopting project and force-installed on upgrade. A list of must-run gates written
# here would be wrong in one of the two places by construction, and would be overwritten in
# the adopter. AGENTS.md is the adopter's, already carries the Test command, and is already
# the file people edit when commands change. Same argument as the divergence markers
# needing to exist on both sides, and the second time this week the answer was "the
# statement lives with the thing it describes".
#
# WHY NOT AN EXPECTED GATE COUNT. Considered and rejected. A count is one number standing
# in for a set: two gates can vanish while one appears and the total is unchanged. Every
# legitimate environment difference forces a re-baseline, which becomes a ritual performed
# without reading. And keyed on an environment fingerprint it mints a fresh baseline
# whenever the fingerprint moves, so the number ends up always correct and never
# informative. The split has none of that.
#
# KEEP THE SET SMALL. A must-run gate that fails the build is a gate people route around,
# and that pressure is worse here than anywhere else in this file. The initial membership
# is exactly the repository's own test suite and nothing else; additions carry a recorded
# reason next to them. If it grows past a handful without reasons, the discipline failed
# rather than the design.
#
# Declared at column 0 in AGENTS.md, same shape and same reason as the scaffold: markers —
# an indented example inside a code block is documentation, not a declaration.

# third time as the job's own audit step. Three runs of one suite per push, two of them
# proving nothing the third did not.
#
# IT IS ALSO WRONG ATTRIBUTION, which matters more than the minutes: an adopter whose
# product suite fails would fail adoption_check — a check named for the scaffold, reporting
# a defect in something else. Skipping it here makes the check answer its own question.

# WHERE SELFTEST DISCOVERY LOOKS. `tools/` always — plus any directory the project DECLARES
# as holding its own product, at column 0 in AGENTS.md:
#
#     <!-- scaffold:product-dir src/localcoder -->
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. `Robiton/localcoder` ships its product at `src/localcoder/`; `tools/` there
# is the vendored governance layer. Scanning only `tools/` meant that repository's own shipped
# executables were the one thing CI never selftested — the exact "a rule with nothing behind
# it" failure the discovery loop was written to prevent, reproduced by the loop itself.
#
# It had been fixing that by EDITING the workflow, which made `scaffold-check.yml` a divergent
# PRODUCT file: every upgrade left a `.scaffold-<version>` sidecar to reconcile by hand, and on
# 2026-08-12 three of those were found tracked and unreconciled since 2026-08-09 — one of them
# this file. A declaration the scaffold reads removes the divergence instead of asking a human
# to remember it on every upgrade.
#
# DECLARED, NEVER INFERRED — the same rule as every other marker here. Globbing for "somewhere
# that looks like a product" would pick up `dist/`, `vendor/` and a stale build tree, and a
# discovery loop that quietly grows is as bad as one that quietly shrinks. An indented example
# inside a code block is documentation, not a declaration.
#
# A DECLARED DIRECTORY THAT DOES NOT EXIST IS A FAILURE, not a skip. Silently ignoring it is

  # The first line of this file says "everything CI will run, before the push instead of
  # after". That was FALSE for one specific suite: this script's own. CI discovers every
  # `tools/*.sh` advertising `--selftest` and runs it -- preflight.sh included -- while
  # preflight excluded ITSELF from that discovery to avoid recursing. So the cases that
  # police preflight ran only on the far side of a push.
  #
  # THE COUNT IS WHY THIS IS NOW A GATE RATHER THAN A THIRD COMMENT. It has produced a
  # local-green/CI-red three times, each recorded at the site that hit it and none of them
  # closing the hole:
  #   1. the must-run declaration case (3d below) -- "structural rather than bad luck"
  #   2. the session_currency wiring (~line 1454) -- "exactly the gap ai/MEMORY.md records"
  #   3. 2026-09-01, the CI-only assertion case, on the very commit adding a matrix leg
  # A gap documented at three separate sites and closed at none is not a known limitation,
  # it is an unfixed defect with good comments.
  #
  # IT DOES RECURSE, AND THE DEPTH GUARD IS THE WHOLE MECHANISM. The first version of this
  # gate carried a comment asserting "NO RECURSION -- --selftest exits before the main
  # flow". That was wrong and it forked 207 processes on the machine that ran it: selftest()
  # copies this file into a fixture and runs THE MAIN FLOW (see the two fixture cases near
  # the end of selftest), so main -> selftest -> main -> selftest is unbounded. The
  # exclusion this gate removes was load-bearing, and only reading selftest() shows why.
  #
  # SCAFFOLD_PREFLIGHT_INNER bounds it at depth 2: the outer run sets it, the fixture runs
  # inherit it, and they skip this gate. Terminating, and the inner runs still execute every
  # OTHER gate, which is what those fixture cases are actually asserting.

  # degrades to a pass when offline is this repository's most-repeated defect. A declared

  # ---- THE DECLARED MUST-RUN GATES. ACTUALLY RUN THEM, INCLUDING ON A RED RUN.
  #
  # MOVED ABOVE THE SUMMARY ON 2026-09-01 (#259). These gates used to sit BELOW the first
  # `if [ -n "$FAILED" ]; then ... return 1`, which meant that on any run where another gate
  # had already failed, the adopter's own declared suite DID NOT RUN -- and was not listed as
  # skipped either, because GAPS is only appended by the skip helpers and these never got as
  # far as being skipped. The one condition under which you most want the product suite --
  # something else is already broken -- was exactly the condition under which it was dropped.
  #
  # AGENTS.md: "A declared gate that does not run is a FAILURE, whatever the reason." The
  # reason here was our own control flow. Reported by an adopter, and it is the FOURTH time
  # this mechanism has failed in a new way (never called; called after the only $FAILED
  # check; verdict discarded; and now not reached on a red run) -- each fix landing one layer
  # below the last, which is why this one moves the call rather than adding another check
  # after it.
  #
  # THIS WAS A PRINTED CLAIM WITH NOTHING BEHIND IT, in the file that exists to prevent
  # exactly that. `MUST_RUN` was parsed from AGENTS.md, and the verdict below printed
  # "MUST-RUN gates declared in AGENTS.md, ALL OF WHICH RAN" — inside the PASSED branch, so
  # the sentence appeared precisely when nothing had checked. `must_gate()` was defined,
  # documented, covered by three selftest cases, and called from NOWHERE but those cases.
  #
  # Measured in Robiton/localcoder on 2026-08-12: `tests/audit_localcoder.sh` was declared
  # must-run and failing (version-files-agree: `version` said 0.22.0, `pyproject.toml` said
  # 0.21.0, so an install reported the wrong one). preflight printed "all of which ran" and
  # PASSED. CI caught it after the push, which is the thing preflight exists to prevent.
  #
  # D-18's shape, inside the mechanism built for D-18, with a sentence asserting the
  # opposite. The selftest cases were not wrong — they proved must_gate() behaves correctly
  # when called. Nothing asserted that it is called, because "is this function reachable"
  # is not a property a unit test of the function can have.

  # by a release going out wrong. v0.16.0 fixed "must_gate is never called" by adding the call
  # — and put it AFTER the `if [ -n "$FAILED" ]` branch above, which is the only place $FAILED
  # is ever consulted. So from that fix until now, a declared must-run gate ran, printed
  # [FAIL], set $FAILED, and preflight printed PREFLIGHT PASSED underneath it.
  #
  # MEASURED IN Robiton/localcoder ON 2026-08-15, and it is the same trigger as last time:

  # `pyproject.toml` 0.38.0, so an install reports the wrong release). preflight said PASSED,
  # the release was tagged and published, and the tag installs under the OLD version string.
  #
  # The previous fix's selftest case greps the main flow to prove must_gate is CALLED. That
  # was the right lesson from the wrong altitude: being called is not the property that
  # matters, being ACTED ON is. The case below now runs a fixture whose must-run gate exits 1

  # ONLY in CI. selftest() runs the MAIN FLOW in fixtures (cases 6 and 7 below), so
  # main -> selftest -> main is unbounded unless something breaks the cycle. The first
  # version of that gate shipped with a comment asserting no recursion was possible; it
  # forked 207 processes on the machine that ran it before being killed by hand.
  #
  # TWO CASES, BECAUSE THE VARIABLE ALONE IS NOT THE INVARIANT. One asserts the marker is
  # live in this very process -- which can only be true if `--selftest` exported it, the
  # half that matters in CI, where discovery invokes `--selftest` DIRECTLY and the main
  # flow never runs. The other asserts the gate call site still reads it, so deleting the
  # `if` while leaving the export in place is caught too.

  # A REGRESSION HERE DOES NOT LOOK LIKE A RED BUILD. It looks like a runner that stops
  # responding, which is the worst shape this project has a name for.

  # the marker and for the `$0 --selftest` call, and a mutation deleting the `if` around the

  # so the marker was "present" while guarding nothing. Second time in this session that a
  # test matched the wrong occurrence of the right string.
  #
  # So: find the line that runs `$0 --selftest` and require the marker within the six lines
  # ABOVE it. That is the guard, and nothing else in this file satisfies it by accident.
  #
  # AND COMMENTS ARE STRIPPED FIRST. The second version DID look at the six lines above the
  # call -- and the mutation survived again, because the paragraph explaining the guard sits
  # in those six lines and says "SCAFFOLD_PREFLIGHT_INNER" in prose. A comment describing a
  # guard satisfied a check for the guard. That is the same defect ci_status.sh fixed on
