# Modified: 2026-09-01
# Version:  0.2.0.20260901.0419
# Purpose:  A release with no session entry behind it is an undocumented release. This says so.
# Changelog:
#   2026-09-01 v0.2.0.20260901.0419 — A CHECK THAT CAN NEVER RUN HERE SAID THE LEAST (#258).
#                        This anchors the session log to the newest tag behind HEAD, and
#                        returned 3 with "no tag behind HEAD yet" for two opposite
#                        situations: a repo that tags and has not yet (temporary -- the next
#                        release fixes it), and a repo that never tags at all (permanent --
#                        nothing anyone installs will make this fire, ever). preflight renders
#                        a 3 under DID NOT RUN, so the permanent case read as a missing
#                        toolchain.
#                        Reported by an adopter whose repo has zero tags and ships from main,
#                        after a long session made six architectural decisions and updated
#                        none of MEMORY/SESSION/BACKLOG -- the exact drift this gate exists to
#                        catch, on a repository where it could not fire.
#                        TWO CASES, NOT ONE: the second asserts a repo that DOES tag is NOT
#                        told the gap is permanent, because a fix that made every rc=3 say
#                        "never" would pass the first case and be wrong.
#   2026-08-30 v0.1.1.20260830.0005 — A ROTTED POINTER IS NO LONGER ADVISORY (#245). run_check()
#                        separated "declared and absent" from "no log at all" on purpose, then
#                        returned the SAME code 1 that "the record is behind" uses -- and the
#                        dispatch treats 1 as advisory. So `--check` printed FAILED and exited
#                        0, and preflight printed [PASS] over a broken declaration. Declared
#                        and absent now returns 4, which is never advisory. Behind still
#                        returns 1 and stays advisory, so upgrading cannot break a push.
#   2026-08-19 v0.1.0 — Initial. Written the morning after shipping EIGHT releases in one day
#                        with zero session entries, through 44 green preflight gates, in a
#                        repository whose AGENTS.md says to checkpoint "at milestones (each
#                        merged PR or completed task)". Nothing checked. Every `SESSION.md`
#                        reference in preflight.sh was TEMPLATE detection — "is this still the
#                        unmodified stub" — and none of them asked whether it was CURRENT.
#                        The rule had been a preference for as long as it had existed.
#
# WHAT THIS CHECKS, AND WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT
#
#   A tag is a milestone nobody can argue about. Prose is not mechanically checkable and this
#   does not try: it will not read your entry, judge whether it is any good, or verify it
#   describes the release. It answers exactly one question --
#
#       Is the newest release OLDER than the newest thing written down about this project?
#
#   -- and that question is enough to have caught the failure that produced this file.
#
#   DATES, NOT CONTENT, ON PURPOSE. An earlier draft required the session log to NAME the
#   newest tag. It fails on a legitimately written entry: "shipped 0.85.0 through 0.92.0"
#   documents eight releases and literally contains two of the eight version strings. A gate
#   that punishes the good summary and passes eight stub headings is worse than a date.
#
# THE TAG AT HEAD IS EXCLUDED, and this is the same rule the changelog needed
#   `release.sh` writes the tag AFTER the commit, so the session entry inside that commit can
#   never name the tag that commit creates. A check demanding otherwise is red at the instant
#   you release, which is a completely normal moment -- and a gate that is red at a normal
#   moment is one people learn to scroll past. That is not a hypothetical here: scrolling
#   past `session hooks are wired but the last start is not a recorded HOOK_RAN`, every run,
#   all day, is half of why this file exists.
#
# WHERE THE LOG LIVES IS DECLARED, because the split moved it out of every gate's view
#   `localcoder`'s session log is in `localcoder-dev`. Every gate ran scoped to the repo it
#   stood in, so the one file that should have been updated was outside the field of view of
#   all 44 of them. A repo whose log lives elsewhere declares it, at column 0 in
#   ai/BACKLOG.md:
#
#       <!-- scaffold:session-log ../localcoder-dev/ai/SESSION.md -->
#
#   IN ai/BACKLOG.md AND NOT IN AGENTS.md, WHICH IS NOT A STYLE CHOICE. `scaffold_upgrade.sh`
#   THREE-WAY MERGES AGENTS.md into every adopter, so a column-0 declaration there would
#   propagate -- pointing every adopter at a `-dev` repository they do not have, which this
#   tool correctly calls a FAILURE. One declaration in the wrong file would have turned this
#   check red for everybody who upgraded. ai/BACKLOG.md is in the never-touched set
#   (SESSION/BACKLOG/MEMORY/TEAM/version/CODEOWNERS), which is why `scaffold:status-repos`
#   already lives there; this follows that precedent rather than inventing a second one.
#
#   Undeclared means `ai/SESSION.md` here, which is right for a repo that was never split.
#   A declared path that does not exist is a FAILURE, not a skip -- otherwise renaming the
#   file retires the check and it just gets quieter, which is the `product-dir` lesson.

session_currency.sh — is the newest release older than the newest session entry?

  --check       report and exit 0 (default; advisory, like every other record check)
  --strict      exit 1 when the log is behind the newest release
  --quiet       verdict line only
  --selftest    run the built-in cases
  -h, --help    this

Exit codes — the distinction matters and used to be lost (#245):
  0   current, or advisory-and-tolerated
  1   the record is BEHIND the newest release — advisory, waved through without --strict
  3   nothing to check (no log declared and none present, or nothing released yet)
  4   the DECLARED log does not exist — a broken configuration, NEVER advisory

Exit: 0 current (or advisory), 1 behind (--strict only), 3 could not run.
Declare a log outside this repo at column 0 in ai/BACKLOG.md (NOT AGENTS.md —
that file is merged into every adopter, so a declaration there propagates):
  <!-- scaffold:session-log ../other-repo/ai/SESSION.md -->
