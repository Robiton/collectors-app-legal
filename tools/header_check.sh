#   2026-09-04 v0.7.0.20260904.0853 — A SQUASHED HISTORY CANNOT DATE ITS OWN FILES (#305). This reads the
#                        COMMITTER date, so in a repo whose whole history is one commit every
#                        file shares it and the baseline amnesty is STRUCTURALLY unreachable —
#                        which is exactly adoption_check's fixture. An adopter who declared a
#                        baseline, went green in their own repo, then saw adoption_check report
#                        the same files had NO action available that could fix it. New state 3,
#                        reported NOT MEASURED, distinct from 2 (shallow clone, where the
#                        history exists and refusing the amnesty is right). Scoped to
#                        baseline-declared + single-commit, so a fresh project with no baseline
#                        is still held to the rule.
#   2026-09-03 v0.6.0.20260903.0510 — A STAMP IN THE FUTURE FAILS AT COMMIT TIME, not at
#                        release (#287). `stamp_not_ahead` compares a stamp to the COMMIT
#                        that carries it, with a two-hour grace, and says nothing about the
#                        wall clock -- and it returns early on a file with no commit yet,
#                        which is every file at the moment it is written.
#                        MEASURED 2026-09-02: three stamps in one session written from
#                        memory rather than read from the clock. One was 17 minutes in the
#                        FUTURE and passed, because 17 minutes is inside the other check's
#                        grace. Two were behind, and behind-the-commit is the direction that
#                        check exists to allow. All three reached a commit.
#                        Nothing can legitimately be built at a time that has not happened.
#                        Five minutes of grace for clock skew and no more -- a wider window
#                        is exactly how a hand-typed stamp gets through. `Modified:` is
#                        checked as a date, because a file modified tomorrow is the same lie
#                        in a coarser unit.
#                        RUNS IN THE BARE FORM, deliberately. `--since` only sees files that
#                        CHANGED; the bare form is what setup.sh --check and a developer run,
#                        and a typed stamp is wrong when it is written, not when it is diffed.
#                        The selftest gives the past case its OWN fixture rather than reusing
#                        past.sh, which is stamped 20 minutes ahead on purpose. The two checks
#                        disagree about that file and both are right, and that disagreement is
#                        the reason this one exists.
#   2026-08-23 v0.5.0 — A HAND-TYPED STAMP AHEAD OF ITS OWN COMMIT IS NOW CAUGHT (#238). The
#                        format rule accepted any well-formed date, so a file re-stamped into
#                        next week satisfied every gate. It happened here: three headers
#                        written .1330/.1345/.1420 against a clock reading 0518/0537/0544, and
#                        preflight passed 38 gates over them three times. Caught only because
#                        `date` was run while cutting the release.
#                        COMPARED AGAINST THE COMMIT THAT CARRIES THE FILE, not against the
#                        clock. "Not in the future" sounds right and breaks every distributed
#                        team -- stamps are minted with local `date`, so a developer east of
#                        the CI runner is legitimately up to fourteen hours "ahead" of it. The
#                        commit's author date carries its own UTC offset and `--date=format:`
#                        renders it in that zone, so both sides come from one clock.
#                        Two hours of grace: a stamp is written before its commit, never after,
#                        and the gap is however long the gates take. Wide enough for any real
#                        cycle, far too narrow for the eight-hour case it exists to catch.
#                        Three selftest cases, both directions, mutation-verified.
#   2026-08-10 v0.4.0 — Document exit 3 in --help, per the convention now in
#                        ai/STANDARDS.md (#188).
#   2026-08-09 v0.3.1 — Say what was NOT checked, and what 'source file' means (#182).
#                        A bare run does not check build stamps and CI runs
#                        --since origin/main, so local green and CI red disagreed for a
#                        reason nothing on screen mentioned. --help now also states that
#                        --since reads the COMMITTED diff, and that .gd/.js/.ts/.go/.rs
#                        are out of scope — an adopter proved both to themselves the hard
#                        way, editing a .gd file and then a file already stamped on the
#                        branch, and concluded twice that they had broken something.
#   2026-08-09 v0.3.0 — SEE FILES THAT DO NOT EXIST YET (#166). Every file list here came
#                        from `git ls-files`, which is TRACKED ONLY — so a source file
#                        created and not yet `git add`ed was invisible to BOTH scans. It
#                        reported clean, and the same file failed CI on the commit that
#                        added it. That is one of the two red builds #166 was filed about:
#                        "a new .py with no header at all".
#                        The suite could not have caught it: its missing-header case ran
#                        `git add -A` first, so the untracked path was never once exercised.
#                        `source_candidates()` is tracked ∪ untracked (--exclude-standard, so
#                        .gitignore still decides what is not source), and --since unions the
#                        new files in as well. A new file is NEW, not "history unreadable" —
#                        it is never baseline-exempt, and it is asked for a complete header
#                        rather than for a stamp that CHANGED, which on a first version is
#                        an instruction with no action behind it.
#   2026-08-05 v0.2.1 — --adopt matches the SLOT'S SHAPE, not upstream's sentence. The
#                        shipped negative declaration asserted a fact about whatever repo
#                        the file landed in, so it had to be reworded — and a matcher keyed
#                        to that sentence would have broken silently.
#   2026-08-05 v0.2.0 — Declared baseline: the rule applies forward, not retroactively (#76)
#   2026-08-04 v0.1.0 — Initial creation
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#   ai/CODING.md -> File headers calls a header MANDATORY on every source file, and
#   ai/STANDARDS.md requires a build stamp on every PR. Nothing checked either one, and
#   the scaffold's own tools had drifted accordingly. Measured 2026-08-04, on the repo
#   that publishes the rule:
#
#     setup.sh                    header said 0.3.1.20260709.1050 — 4 versions and
#                                 ~4 weeks behind its own last change
#     tools/localcoder            substantially rewritten; header still said 2026-07-31
#     tools/session_archive.py    no Version line at all
#     sync-check.sh               no header at all
#     tools/audit_localcoder.sh   stale
#     tools/localcoder_bench.py   stale
#
#   This is the same failure as the archive ceiling that reached 1,001 lines: the rule
#   was stated, everyone agreed with it, and nothing was watching. A rule that depends
#   on remembering it at the end of a long session is a rule that quietly stops holding.
#
#   The stamp is not bookkeeping for its own sake. `Modified:` is how a reader decides
#   whether a comment describing a measurement still describes the code.
#
# WHAT COUNTS AS A SOURCE FILE HERE
#   Shell and Python — tracked `*.sh`, `*.py`, and extensionless tracked files whose
#   first line is a shebang. Markdown, JSON, SVG and workflow YAML are excluded: they
#   carry their provenance differently (front matter, a `name:` key) and stamping them
#   would be ceremony rather than information. EXCLUDE is the escape hatch; add to it in
#   a reviewed commit, so an exemption is a decision rather than an oversight.
#
# THE RULE APPLIES FORWARD, NOT RETROACTIVELY
#   Reported from a real 0.5.0 -> 0.6.3 upgrade (#76): making this check blocking failed an
#   existing adoption's ENTIRE codebase at once — 33 files written long before the standard
#   was — and the PR could not merge. The cost scales with how old and large a project is,
#   so it lands hardest on exactly the projects with the most to gain from upgrading, and
#   the likely outcome is not that people write 33 headers. It is that they stop upgrading.
#
#   Both escape hatches at the time lived in files `scaffold_upgrade.sh` REPLACES — EXCLUDE
#   below, and --warn-only wired into the workflow — so any local accommodation was erased
#   by the next upgrade. And downgrading a blocking check locally is precisely the loosening
#   `ai/STANDARDS.md` -> *Rule precedence* forbids, so an adopter who followed the standards
#   had no sanctioned way out and one who worked around it broke a different rule to do it.
#
#   So the exemption is DECLARED, in a file upgrades merge rather than overwrite:
#
#       <!-- scaffold:header-baseline YYYY-MM-DD -->      in ai/STANDARDS.md
#
#   A tracked source file whose last commit predates that date is `legacy`: reported,
#   counted, and NOT failed. Touch it and it is in scope on the spot — the baseline exempts
#   history, never future work. No marker means no exemption, so a project that adopts the
#   standard on day one is unaffected and nothing is inferred from absence.
#
#   `--adopt` writes the marker and prints exactly what it exempts, so the amnesty is a
#   visible decision with a number attached rather than a checker quietly going soft.
#
# Usage:
#   tools/header_check.sh                 # every tracked source file has a valid header
#   tools/header_check.sh --since <ref>   # every file changed since <ref> was re-stamped
#   tools/header_check.sh --since origin/main --warn-only    # report, always exit 0
#   tools/header_check.sh --adopt         # declare today as this project's header baseline
#   tools/header_check.sh --list-legacy   # name the files the baseline is exempting
#   tools/header_check.sh --no-baseline   # ignore any declared baseline; check everything

THE BASELINE. A file whose last commit predates the declared baseline is `legacy`:
reported, counted, never failed. Edit it and it is in scope immediately — the baseline
exempts history, not future work. Declare one when adopting the standard into an
existing codebase; a project that starts with it needs no marker at all.

WHAT "SOURCE FILE" MEANS HERE, because it is narrower than it sounds and the output does
not say so. Tracked shell and python files, plus EXTENSIONLESS tracked files with a
shebang (that is how `tools/localcoder` is covered). **`.gd`, `.js`, `.ts`, `.go`, `.rs`
and `.md` are NOT in scope** — editing one and expecting a finding proves nothing, and an
adopter lost time to exactly that.

`--since` READS THE COMMITTED DIFF (plus the working tree and untracked files). Run it
before `git commit` and it reports clean on changes it has not been shown. Order matters:

    git commit ...  &&  tools/preflight.sh  &&  git push

A second edit to a file already re-stamped on this branch also proves nothing — a stamp
cannot go stale twice. To see this tool fail on purpose, commit a change to a file that
this branch has NOT already touched.

CI RUNS `--since origin/main`, NOT THE BARE FORM. The bare run is a strictly weaker check,
so local green and CI red can disagree for a reason you cannot see. `tools/preflight.sh`
runs both and is the command to reach for.

Exit codes: 0 clean, 1 findings, 2 usage error, 3 SKIPPED (verified nothing —
git unavailable). See ai/STANDARDS.md -> 'Exit 3 means I verified nothing'.

# A STAMP TYPED BY HAND IS NOT CHECKED AGAINST ANYTHING (#238). The format rule below accepts
# any well-formed date, so a file re-stamped into next week satisfies every gate. It happened:
# three headers written `.1330`, `.1345`, `.1420` while the clock read `0518`, `0537`, `0544`
# — eight hours ahead — and preflight passed 38 gates three times over them. It was caught only
# because `date` was run while cutting the release.
#
# ai/STANDARDS.md states the cost: a stamp rounded forward makes the next honest release sort
# EARLIER than its predecessor, and every benchmark row and envelope carries a version, so the
# corpus sorts wrong from then on.
#
# COMPARED AGAINST THE COMMIT THAT CARRIES THE FILE, NOT AGAINST THE CLOCK. "Not in the future"
# sounds right and breaks every distributed team: stamps are minted with local `date`, so a
# developer east of the CI runner is legitimately up to fourteen hours "ahead" of it. The
# commit's author date is recorded WITH its own UTC offset, and `--date=format:` renders it in
# that same zone — so both sides of this comparison come from one clock, whoever owns it.
#
# Two hours of grace: a stamp is written before the commit that carries it, never after, and
# the gap is however long the gates take. Wide enough for any real stamp-then-commit cycle,
# far too narrow for the eight-hour case this exists to catch.
# A STAMP MAY NOT SIT IN THE FUTURE, AND THAT IS A DIFFERENT QUESTION FROM stamp_not_ahead.
#
# `stamp_not_ahead` compares the stamp to the COMMIT that carries it, with a two-hour grace.
# It says nothing about the wall clock, and it returns early on a file with no commit yet --
# which is every file at the moment you are writing it.
#
# MEASURED 2026-09-02, three stamps in one session written from memory rather than read from
# the clock: one 17 minutes in the future, two behind it. Every one reached a commit. The
# future one passed `stamp_not_ahead` because 17 minutes is inside its grace, and the two
# behind passed because behind-the-commit is the direction that check exists to allow.
#
# A stamp ahead of NOW is unambiguous: nothing can legitimately be built at a time that has
# not happened. Five minutes of grace for clock skew between a checkout and a runner, and no
# more -- a wider window is how a hand-typed stamp gets through, which is the whole defect.
#
# THE DATE-ONLY FIELD IS CHECKED TOO. `Modified:` is a date, so it is compared as a date;
# a file modified tomorrow is the same lie in a coarser unit.

### File-header baseline

This project adopted the file-header rule on $TODAY, with $pending file(s) already in
tree that predate it. The rule applies from that date forward: those files are exempt
until they are edited, and every file touched on or after it must carry a header.

<!-- scaffold:header-baseline $TODAY -->

\`tools/header_check.sh --list-legacy\` names what is still exempt. Delete the line above
once that list is empty — it is an amnesty for existing history, not a permanent opt-out.
