# Purpose:  Run this scaffold's own gates inside a synthetic ADOPTION, and fail if they
#           fail there. The gap that produced four defects in one evening.
# Changelog:
#   2026-09-04 v0.10.0.20260904.0224 — a fourth scenario: overlay_writes() applies all seven overlays to a project
#                        that already has content and asserts nothing was overwritten — ten
#                        paths each, including the memory, backlog, session and archive files.
#                        Those were safe only because they are on no delivery list, which
#                        holds until somebody adds a line. Mutation-tested: putting #299 back
#                        names `version` in all seven and THREAT_MODEL.md in security-tool.
#   2026-09-03 v0.9.1.20260903.1929 — guide_adoption() skips, out loud, where docs/ADOPTION_GUIDE.md and overlays/
#                        do not exist. It read $ROOT unconditionally and reddened three
#                        adopters on the upgrade that shipped it.
#   2026-09-03 v0.9.0.20260903.1906 — A THIRD SCENARIO, BUILT FROM THE GUIDE AND RUNNING AN OVERLAY THAT WRITES
#                       (#297). The two existing scenarios build from a CLONE and apply
#                       python-script/base — the two overlays that write the least — so a path
#                       missing from ADOPTION_GUIDE.md was present in the fixture anyway, and
#                       nothing ever ran the splunk-app overlay where #291 and #292 lived.
#                       guide_adoption() extracts the guide's own fenced copy block and
#                       EXECUTES it, at apps/TA-fixture inside a repository, then applies the
#                       splunk overlay. It found two further defects on its first run: the
#                       guide never copied .cursor/rules/base.mdc, and the audit-log rule was
#                       skipped in every monorepo adoption. No preflight inside — the other
#                       two scenarios pay for that, and what is under test here is what
#                       setup.sh WROTE.
#   2026-09-01 v0.8.0.20260901.0249 — THIS SCENARIO CALLED A SAFETY REFUSAL A FAILURE, IN EVERY
#                        ADOPTER, AND THE RELEASE GATE COULD NOT SEE IT. new_project() clones
#                        $ROOT and asserts setup.sh completes. In the scaffold $ROOT IS the
#                        scaffold. In an adopter it is not -- adoption sheds overlays/, and
#                        0.82.5 made setup.sh REFUSE (exit 2) outside a scaffold checkout
#                        rather than half-create a tree. So 0.82.5 shipped green here and
#                        turned preflight red in all four repositories carrying it, on a
#                        deliberate refusal working exactly as designed.
#                        The adopter half is NOT a skip: a skip would drop the #256 guard out
#                        of coverage in precisely the population it protects. Inverted, it is
#                        a real gate -- the refusal travelled with the product, and it still
#                        writes nothing before refusing.
#                        THE SECOND ASSERTION COMPARES `git status --porcelain`, NOT `find`.
#                        The first version compared path lists and a mutation moving the
#                        guard back below `echo "$FULL_VERSION" > version` -- the literal
#                        #256 defect -- SURVIVED it, because an adopter already has a version
#                        file and overwriting it changes no path. A test that cannot fail on
#                        the defect it names is worse than no test: it reports coverage.
#   2026-08-30 v0.7.2.20260830.0023 — Two assertions on setup.sh's session-log stripper: that a new
#                        project does not inherit the declaration (#244), and that setup.sh
#                        SURVIVES a BACKLOG.md containing only it. The second is the one that
#                        matters: the happy-path test passes whether or not `grep -v` is
#                        guarded, which is exactly how that abort shipped.
#   2026-08-30 v0.7.1.20260830.0005 — The whole-tree fixture strips the scaffold's own
#                        scaffold:session-log declaration, as setup.sh now does for a real
#                        adopter (#244). This fixture is a COPY and never runs setup.sh, so
#                        it carried a pointer to ../ai-project-scaffold-dev that no adoption
#                        has. Invisible until #245 made a rotted pointer non-advisory, at
#                        which point this fixture failed preflight on the first run. The gate
#                        was right and the fixture was stale; weakening the gate to keep the
#                        fixture green is the trade this project refuses.
#   2026-08-23 v0.7.0 — THE FIXTURE COPIED WHAT git add DECLINES TO STAGE (#227). `tar` does
#                        not consult .gitignore, so each of the sixteen fixture builds copied
#                        the whole working tree and `git add -A` then tracked a fraction of it.
#                        Measured in an adopter's repo: 3.5 GB copied against 668 MB staged --
#                        81% waste, sixteen times, ~45 GB of pointless I/O per selftest, of
#                        which 739 MB was a Godot import cache regenerated on demand.
#                        Now copies `git ls-files -co --exclude-standard`, which IS the set
#                        `git add -A` stages: tracked, plus untracked that is not ignored.
#                        HONEST ABOUT THE LOCAL EFFECT: this repository is 6.3 MB, so the
#                        saving here is 3.5 -> 1.9 MB and the selftest still takes ~73s,
#                        unchanged within noise. The win scales with what the ADOPTER ignores
#                        and is not measurable from inside this repo. Verdicts byte-identical
#                        before and after.
#                        Falls back to the whole-tree copy if git cannot enumerate. A fixture
#                        that could not be built is a case that could not run, which is worse
#                        than one that is slow.
#                        STAMPED 0.47.0 ON THE FIRST ATTEMPT, forty versions ahead of the 0.6.0
#                        this file was actually on. The "0.46.0" in #227 is the SCAFFOLD
#                        release, not this tool, and the two were read as one. Corrected before
#                        anything pinned it -- a per-file header is not a published tag, so
#                        unlike the 1.0.0 case in localcoder this one could still be walked
#                        back. Shipped in scaffold 0.79.0 with the wrong number; 0.79.1 is the
#                        correction.
#   2026-08-17 v0.6.0.20260817.0322 — the two scenarios run CONCURRENTLY (#214). 114s -> 60s
#                        on this machine, with nothing removed from what is verified.
#                        PROFILED BEFORE TOUCHING ANYTHING, because the report said plainly
#                        that its diagnosis was inference from reading the script. It was two
#                        full inner preflights -- 43s and 42s, 75% of the cost -- plus 17s of
#                        context_survival and 10s across two setup.sh runs: 112s of a 114s
#                        run. Neither preflight is redundant, since an adoption and a
#                        from-scratch setup.sh project are different trees and the defect
#                        this file exists for was in what setup.sh LEAVES BEHIND. They share
#                        nothing but a read-only source tree, so they overlap.
#                        AND I COULD NOT REPRODUCE THE REPORTED 297s: 114s here at 0.45.0 on
#                        an M5 Max against 297s there at 0.42.0 on an M3 Max. Both are
#                        probably true; the ratio is 2.6x and it decides how much surgery is
#                        warranted, so it is recorded rather than smoothed over.
#                        NOT CACHED, NOT TIERED. A cache keyed on the scaffold version goes
#                        stale against the working tree and would hide the regression this
#                        check exists to catch. A slow tier is unsound while Actions are
#                        down, because nothing would guarantee it ever runs -- this
#                        repository's own argument about checks that stop running, applied to
#                        itself.
#                        THE SHORT-CIRCUIT IS GONE, which is a correctness change riding
#                        along: it was `run && new_project`, so a failure in the first hid
#                        the second entirely. That is exactly the complaint preflight.sh
#                        makes about CI in its own header, and this file was doing it.
#                        Mutation-verified: either scenario failing exits 1, and with both
#                        failing BOTH are reported rather than one.
#                        It also states up front what it does and prints its own MEASURED
#                        wall clock at the end -- no hardcoded "~5 minutes", which is a claim
#                        that rots on the next machine, as #214 itself demonstrates.
#   2026-08-15 v0.5.0.20260815.1100 — Plant a crashing scanner and assert setup.sh --check names it as a
#                        crash rather than printing an empty red (#212). It found a regression
#                        in that very fix immediately: a bare assignment under `set -e` took
#                        the whole script down.
#   2026-08-15 v0.4.0.20260815.0800 — Assert that a new project does not inherit the source repo's
#                        scaffold:must-run declaration. Same class as the CODEOWNERS case
#                        beside it: a statement about somebody else's product carried into a
#                        repository that cannot satisfy it, silent until the adopter's first
#                        push — and silent HERE until preflight stopped printing PASSED over a
#                        failing must-run gate.
#   2026-08-12 v0.3.1 — REPORT THE NESTED CAUSE, not just the gate that wrapped it.
#                        `[FAIL] setup.sh --check` is one gate around five scanners, so the
#                        failure line named the wrapper and nothing else. On 2026-08-12 that
#                        cost a full CI round trip: the failure reproduced on Linux only and
#                        the log said nothing a local run could act on. A check that reports
#                        a failure it cannot explain sends you off to reproduce it, which is
#                        the cost this fixture exists to remove.
#   2026-08-12 v0.3.0 — A CHECK MUST NOT MUTATE THE THING IT CHECKS, and this file could not
#                        see that it did. preflight was performing a real upgrade of the
#                        repository it was checking (scaffold_upgrade.sh v0.18.0), and every
#                        assertion here passed throughout — the fixture is a throwaway copy,
#                        so a mutation inside it is invisible. Asserting on the fixture's own
#                        CLEANLINESS afterwards is the missing half.
#                        AND THE FIXTURE IS NOW STAMPED BEHIND. The new assertion PASSED
#                        against a known-bad tree on its first run, because the fixture was at
#                        the newest release and the stray upgrade had nothing to change. A
#                        fixture that cannot reach the state under test reports a pass for a
#                        live defect.
#   2026-08-12 v0.2.0 — THE SECOND DOWNSTREAM SHAPE. This file modelled docs/ADOPTION_GUIDE.md
#                        (an existing project that took the scaffold) and nothing modelled
#                        docs/QUICK_START.md (clone the scaffold AS your project, run
#                        setup.sh). The second produces a tree carrying all three signals
#                        is_upstream_repo keys on, so a brand-new adopter was classified as
#                        THE SCAFFOLD: writing a dated ai/SESSION.md entry — the first thing
#                        AGENTS.md instructs — failed their preflight on two gates that exist
#                        only to police this repository. Found by running the published
#                        0.37.1 tarball end to end, not by reading.
#   2026-08-12 v0.1.1 — mktemp -d, BARE. The first version wrote `${TMPDIR:-/tmp%/}` trying
#                        to trim a cosmetic double slash — `%/` inside a DEFAULT VALUE is a
#                        literal, not a suffix strip. macOS sets TMPDIR so the default never
#                        fired; Linux CI does not, so it tried `/tmp%//adoption.XXXXXX`,
#                        failed, and fell back to creating `/adopt` at the filesystem root.
#                        A lesson this repo had already paid for once ($TMPDIR unbound on
#                        Linux under set -u) and I did not apply. Reproduced locally with
#                        `env -u TMPDIR` before and after.
#   2026-08-12 v0.1.0 — Initial. WE HAD NO ADOPTER IN CI, AND THAT IS A DEFECT CLASS.
#                        Every rule that is true of the scaffold and false of an adoption
#                        shipped green. On 2026-08-11 that single gap produced four defects
#                        in one evening — W-05's baseline resolving a scaffold tag against
#                        the adopter's repo, `--from "$ROOT"` one call site later, the
#                        no-localcoder-execution rule firing on adopters USING localcoder,
#                        and the context budget demanding they delete working policy. None
#                        was reachable by anything we run. All four were found by one
#                        person upgrading a real project, and two of them had to be
#                        reported twice.
#                        THE REASON THE EXISTING FIXTURES CANNOT COVER IT: they are built
#                        FROM the scaffold, so they carry `overlays/`, `OVERVIEW.md` and
#                        resolvable release tags. Those three are exactly what
#                        `is_upstream_repo` keys on, so a fixture that has them cannot
#                        express the adopter case at all — it is not that the tests were
#                        thin, it is that the shape was unreachable.
#                        A FIFTH DEFECT WOULD ALSO HAVE BEEN CAUGHT, and it is the one that
#                        matters most: `overlay application (python-script)` passed in an
#                        adoption while asserting NOTHING, because make_template_clone tars
#                        `overlays/` with stderr discarded. It was reported to us AS A PASS.
#                        This check asserts on the VERDICT, so a vacuous green is not
#                        enough — see the skip-not-pass assertion below.

# TWO INDEPENDENT SCENARIOS, RUN CONCURRENTLY (#214).
#
# PROFILED BEFORE CHANGING ANYTHING, because the report said outright that its diagnosis was
# inference. Measured here with `PS4=+[$SECONDS] bash -x`, scaffold 0.45.0, M5 Max:
#
#     43s  tools/preflight.sh              (inside new_project)
#     42s  tools/preflight.sh --allow-dirty (inside run)
#     17s  tools/context_survival.sh
#      5s  bash setup.sh --type python-script
#      5s  bash setup.sh --check
#            -> 112s of a 114s run
#
# So it is TWO FULL PREFLIGHTS, 85s between them, 75% of the cost. One outer preflight
# therefore pays for three preflight runs. Neither inner run is redundant -- an adoption and
# a from-scratch `setup.sh` project are different trees, and the defect this file exists for
# was in what setup.sh LEAVES BEHIND -- so the fix is to overlap them, not to drop one.
# They build separate fixtures in separate temp directories and share nothing but the
# read-only source tree.
#
# NOT CACHED and NOT TIERED, deliberately. A cache keyed on the scaffold version would go
# stale against the working tree and hide exactly the regression this check exists to catch;
# and a slow tier is unsound while Actions are down, because nothing would guarantee it ever
# runs -- this repository's own argument, applied to itself.
#
# AND NEITHER SCENARIO SHORT-CIRCUITS THE OTHER ANY MORE. It was `run && new_project`, so a
# failure in the first hid the second completely. That is the precise complaint preflight.sh
# makes about CI in its own header -- "a push teaches you about exactly one failure and hides
# the next behind it" -- and this file was doing it too.
# ---- SCENARIO 3: THE ADOPTION THE GUIDE ACTUALLY DESCRIBES, WITH AN OVERLAY (#297).
#
# The two scenarios above build their fixture from a CLONE of this repository and apply
# `--type python-script`. Both choices hid real defects for months:
#
#   - A clone contains every path, so a path missing from docs/ADOPTION_GUIDE.md's copy
#     block is present in the fixture anyway. `.githooks/` was absent from the guide for
#     two releases and no fixture could notice (#294).
#   - python-script and base are the two overlays that WRITE THE LEAST. Everything in
#     #291 and #292 lives in the splunk-app overlay, which nothing here ever ran.
#
# So this scenario builds the fixture BY EXECUTING THE GUIDE'S OWN COPY BLOCK — if the guide
# stops copying something, this fixture stops having it — and then applies the overlay that
# writes files. No preflight inside: the two scenarios above already pay for that, and what
# is under test here is what setup.sh WROTE, not whether the gates pass afterwards.

# ---- SCENARIO 4: NO OVERLAY DESTROYS ANYTHING THE PROJECT ALREADY HAD (#299).
#
# Every overlay writes template documents for the project it is applying to, and applying an
# overlay to an EXISTING project is a documented mode. Each of those writes was a plain
# `cat >`. Measured across all seven with a fixture holding real content:
#
#   - `version` was reset from 9.9.9 to 0.1.0 by ALL SEVEN, despite ADOPTION_GUIDE.md saying
#     in so many words that the file is the adopter's and is deliberately not copied.
#   - the security-tool overlay replaced a filled-in `docs/THREAT_MODEL.md` with an empty
#     stub — in a security project, the document most expensive to lose.
#
# THE MEMORY AND ARCHIVE FILES WERE ALREADY SAFE, and this scenario exists partly to keep
# them that way: ai/MEMORY.md, ai/BACKLOG.md, ai/SESSION.md, ai/TEAM.md and the three
# *_ARCHIVE.md files are asserted here on every run, in every overlay. They are on no
# delivery list, which is why they survive — and "it is safe because nothing lists it" is
# exactly the kind of guarantee that holds until someone adds a line.
#
# CHEAP: seven `setup.sh --type` runs, no preflight, no network.
