# Modified: 2026-08-26
# Version:  0.2.0.20260826.1525
# Purpose:  Capture a correction VERBATIM at the moment it is given, because the thing that
#           gets lost is not the decision, it is the sentence that produced it.
# Changelog:
#   2026-08-26 v0.2.0 — PATTERN HEALTH (#242): --health reports promoted/captured per rule and
#                        --promote records one. It needs no inference, because the acceptance
#                        signal already exists and a person already makes it: step 3 of
#                        "Corrections are learnings" is a human writing a correction into
#                        ai/MEMORY.md. All that was missing was which rule found it.
#                        A rule with zero promotions across >=5 captures is NAMED as dead --
#                        a report that cannot say so is decoration.
#                        DELIBERATELY NOT the source project's --use-meta, which feeds the
#                        score back into detection confidence: a keyword scorer tuning its own
#                        scores, with nobody reading the result. Nothing here adjusts anything.
#   2026-08-26 v0.1.1 — LICENCE CORRECTED, and this is not a footnote. The source below was
#                        recorded as MIT on the strength of its README. It has NO LICENSE
#                        FILE: `GET /repos/.../license` is 404 and the root listing has no
#                        LICENSE/LICENCE/COPYING. GitHub's default for an unlicensed public
#                        repo is all rights reserved, so a licence named in prose is not the
#                        grant. No exposure here -- what was taken is the IDEA of capturing on
#                        the Stop hook, every line below was written here, and their MEDIUM
#                        and LOW tiers are not implemented at all -- but nothing may be COPIED
#                        from that repository until a real licence exists. Recorded in
#                        ai/PROVENANCE.md, which is the file that made the check happen.
#                        ALSO: we evaluated v1.0.0 while v1.3.0 had been out a month, and both
#                        criticisms below have upstream answers. See ai/PROVENANCE.md.
#   2026-08-26 v0.1.0 — Initial. The idea is taken from haddock-development/claude-reflect-system
#                        (licence: NONE DECLARED -- see ai/PROVENANCE.md); the inferring half is NOT taken,
#                        and the reason is measured rather than aesthetic. That project scores
#                        matches into HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW confidence and then EDITS SKILL FILES
#                        from them. This project has already measured that exact instrument
#                        twice: localcoder #185 (gotcha selection ranks by keyword and ranks
#                        the wrong entry first) and the SPL time-bound advisory, which fired
#                        53 times against real saved searches and was NOISE 41 of those times
#                        -- 85% wrong, narrowed to 12 rules, most of it deleted. A keyword
#                        scorer that writes to files is that same instrument pointed at the
#                        record itself.
#
#                        So this tool keeps their good half and drops their inferring half:
#                          - It CAPTURES. It never classifies, never scores, never rewrites
#                            any file except by appending to the journal.
#                          - It quotes the matched SENTENCE verbatim, not a paraphrase and
#                            not the whole message.
#                          - MEDIUM and LOW are not implemented at all. "Yes, that's exactly
#                            right" confirms one instance and is not a rule; "have you
#                            considered X" is a question. Both are pure noise generators in
#                            a file whose value is that it is short enough to read.
#
# THE SPLIT THIS PRESERVES, from tools/session_journal.sh
#   Hooks capture FACTS. The agent writes NARRATIVE. A sentence the user actually typed is a
#   fact. What it MEANT is narrative, and a hook that guesses at it produces the journal
#   nobody reads -- which is the failure mode session_journal.sh v0.3.0 was written to fix
#   when it was logging itself on every turn.
#
# WHY THIS IS NEEDED AT ALL, stated as the failure it prevents
#   ai/SESSION.md is written at the end. ai/MEMORY.md gets a gotcha when someone remembers to
#   write one. On 2026-08-25 this programme shipped fourteen releases across four repos with
#   ZERO session entries, while tools/session_currency.sh printed BEHIND on every preflight
#   run and preflight logged it `ok` because --check is advisory. Discipline had already been
#   tried and had already failed twice in the same file. Capture is not a substitute for
#   writing the record; it is what makes writing it possible hours later.
#
# WHAT IT WILL NOT DO, and these are safety properties with tests
#   - It will not write outside ai/SESSION_JOURNAL.md.
#   - It will not emit a secret. Every captured sentence is redacted first (see redact()).
#     The journal is a file people paste into issues; a correction that names a token would
#     put that token somewhere it was never meant to go, and secret_scan.sh does not read it.
#   - It will not capture from anything but a real user turn. In a Claude Code transcript,
#     tool results, command stdout and <system-reminder> blocks all arrive with role=user.
#     They are not the user speaking, and the negative half of the selftest is mostly this.
#   - It will not fail a session. Every path returns 0 to a hook caller.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------- the patterns
#
# NARROW ON PURPOSE. Every pattern here is an EXPLICIT correction -- the user rejecting a
# thing and/or naming the replacement. There is no tier below this one, because the tiers
# below it are where a keyword scorer earns its 85% noise rate.
#
# Each entry is (name, compiled regex). The name is recorded so that a bad pattern can be
# identified and removed from evidence rather than from memory -- see --measure.
# THE EXPLICIT MARKER, and it is not my invention -- ai/STANDARDS.md -> "Corrections are
# learnings" already declares it: *"A human-typed `remember:` prefix marks something as a
# learning explicitly -- honor it in any tool, no tooling required."* This is the tooling.
# It is the only rule that BYPASSES MAX_TURN, because a person who typed the marker has
# stated intent, and a heuristic must not overrule a statement.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------- pattern health
#
# `--measure` counts precision BY HAND, ONCE, against one transcript. That is how the shipped
# rules got from 63 matches to 3, and it is a one-off: nothing tracks whether a rule stays
# good after the day it was calibrated.
#
# THE ACCEPTANCE SIGNAL ALREADY EXISTS AND A PERSON ALREADY MAKES IT. ai/STANDARDS.md ->
# "Corrections are learnings" is capture, review, apply. Step 3 -- a human deciding a
# correction is recurring and writing it into ai/MEMORY.md -- IS the judgement. All that was
# missing is recording which rule produced the candidate that earned it.
#
#     pattern health = promoted / captured, per rule
#
# Measured, not remembered. A rule at 0-for-15 is the `instead of` rule again and should be
# deleted; a rule at 12-for-14 has earned the right to be widened.
#
# WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY IS NOT. The source project's v1.3.0 pairs this with `--use-meta`,
# which feeds the score back into detection confidence. That is the loop closing on itself: a
# keyword scorer tuning its own keyword scores, with nobody reading the result. The value here
