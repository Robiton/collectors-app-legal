#   2026-09-03 v0.6.0.20260903.0805 — AN ISSUE COUNT IS NOT A FACT ABOUT THIS TREE (#288).
#                        Closing an issue made this gate red. Nothing in the repository
#                        changed; somebody clicked a button on GitHub.
#                        MEASURED: five refreshes in two days, every one because an issue was
#                        closed AFTER the block was written, one of them mid-release where
#                        the entire fix was "run the tool again".
#                        A gate that fires predictably after a normal action, with a fixed
#                        one-command remedy and no decision in it, is one people learn to
#                        clear on autopilot -- and then clear on the day it mattered. That
#                        argument is already in this repository twice (#282, and the archive
#                        ceiling before it).
#                        SO THE COLUMNS ARE NOT EQUAL. A version, an adoption marker or a CI
#                        conclusion is a fact about this tree and drift there still FAILS. An
#                        open-issue count is a fact about a website, carried for orientation:
#                        drift in that column ALONE is reported and exits 0. --write still
#                        refreshes everything, so the number is never wrong for long.
#                        The selftest pins the MASK in both directions, because the way this
#                        breaks is blanking the wrong field -- which would swallow a version
#                        drift and leave the gate unfalsifiable.
#   2026-08-26 v0.5.0 — A CI STATE STILL IN FLIGHT IS NO LONGER A DIFFERENCE (#241).
#                        The CI column reports the newest run on main, and that state changes
#                        AS A DIRECT RESULT OF THE PUSH THE BLOCK IS COMMITTED IN -- so
#                        --write, commit, push, preflight was reliably STALE with nothing
#                        wrong. Observed three times in one session. That is a gate red at a
#                        completely normal moment, the property session_currency.sh argues
#                        against in its own header, and it trains the wrong repair: re-run
#                        --write and commit, which pushes again, which starts another run.
#                        queued / in_progress / requested / waiting now adopt whatever the
#                        file already says for that row. success and failure still compare
#                        exactly -- settling those would make the column unfalsifiable, which
#                        is worse than the false red, and there is a selftest case asserting
#                        precisely that.
#                        The first draft passed the committed text through `awk -v`, where a
#                        multi-line value is mangled: it matched nothing and staled every row.
#                        Two-file NR==FNR instead.
#   2026-08-20 v0.4.0 — THE CI COLUMN READ ANY BRANCH, NOT main. `--limit 1` with no
#                        --branch takes the newest Scaffold Check run in the repository,
#                        so a failing feature branch is reported as the repository's CI
#                        state. Measured: localcoder-dev showed `failure` while every run
#                        on main was green, because an M3 results branch had a red run one
#                        minute newer. It flip-flopped success/failure/success across three
#                        consecutive regenerations -- worse than being wrong once, because
#                        a gate that looks flaky is one people stop reading.
#                        release.sh carried this same defect and had it fixed; this is the
#                        other tool asking the same question and nobody checked it.
#                        An in-progress run has a null conclusion, which printed as empty
#                        and read as a missing answer rather than a pending one; now named.
#   2026-08-18 v0.3.0.20260818.1918 — A BLOCK THAT CANNOT BE DERIVED HERE IS EXIT 3, NOT A
#                        FAILURE, and --write refuses rather than shortening the table.
#                        The block names sibling repositories by relative path. On a machine
#                        without them -- a fresh clone, a CI runner, an adopter who inherited
#                        the markers -- render() quietly produced a table with NO ROWS: so
#                        --check called a perfectly correct block STALE, and --write would
#                        have DESTROYED the real table and called that an update.
#                        Caught by adoption_check, which builds a new project from a clone and
#                        found its preflight RED ON ARRIVAL -- which this project's own rule
#                        says is a preflight people learn to skip, including for the gates
#                        that matter.
#   2026-08-18 v0.2.0.20260818.1827 — TWO DEFECTS IN MY OWN 0.1.x, both from the families this
#                        programme keeps naming.
#                        (1) THE GATE COULD NEVER BE GREEN. The written block reported HEAD,
#                        dirty and sync FOR THE REPO THAT HOSTS IT — three facts the act of
#                        writing and committing the block changes. `--write` made dirty 1;
#                        committing moved HEAD. So `--check` reported STALE immediately after
#                        a successful `--write`, forever, with nothing wrong. A gate that
#                        fires on every green run is one people learn to filter out — the
#                        exact lesson already recorded here about the Node 20 notice.
#                        Fix: the block carries only facts that survive its own commit
#                        (tag, version, adopts, issues, CI). The volatile working-tree view
#                        moved to `--status`, which prints and never writes.
#                        (2) THE SELFTEST WAS VACUOUS. It ran a hand-written `s.replace()`
#                        instead of the splice, so it passed whether or not the tool worked,
#                        and could not have caught (1). It now drives the real --write/--check
#                        paths and asserts the property that was broken: check is clean
#                        immediately after write, and write is idempotent.
#   2026-08-18 v0.1.0.20260818.1800 — Initial. A HAND-MAINTAINED STATUS TABLE HAS NOW GONE
#                        STALE TWICE IN THIS PROGRAMME, the second time inside a block whose
#                        own text says "Re-derived, not copied — the block below this one used
#                        to be six releases stale and that lesson is kept." It re-staled by
#                        twelve releases within a day of being hand-corrected, and an outside
#                        review flagged it in two consecutive assessments.
#                        Discipline has been tried and has failed twice, so the answer is
#                        derivation. Human commentary lives OUTSIDE the markers and is never
#                        touched; only the region between them is rewritten.
#                        --check fails on drift, so a stale block is a gate result rather than
#                        something a reader has to notice.

# A CI STATE THAT IS STILL MOVING IS NOT A DIFFERENCE (#241).
#
# The CI column reports the newest Scaffold Check run on main. That state changes AS A DIRECT
# RESULT OF THE PUSH THE BLOCK IS COMMITTED IN, so the sequence is:
#
#     --write            CI: success
#     commit ; push      <- this push starts a run
#     preflight          CI: in_progress-pending  ->  STALE, exit 1
#
# Nothing is wrong at that moment. The block was regenerated minutes earlier and was correct
# when written. That is a gate red at a completely normal moment, which is the property
# session_currency.sh argues against in its own header -- and it trains the wrong repair:
# re-run --write, commit, which pushes again, which starts another run, which makes it stale
# again. Observed three times in one session before this existed.
#
# SO ONLY TERMINAL STATES ARE COMPARED. queued / in_progress / requested / waiting -- the
# states that exist only BETWEEN a push and its result -- adopt whatever the file already
# says for that row, because no committed file can track them. success and failure still
# compare exactly: those are the ones a stale block would be lying about.

    # ---- AN ISSUE COUNT IS NOT A FACT ABOUT THIS TREE (#288) ----------------------------

    # because an issue was closed AFTER the block was written, and one of them mid-release
    # where the fix was "run the tool again" and nothing else.
    #
    # A gate that fires predictably after a normal action, with a fixed one-command remedy
    # and no decision attached, is one people learn to clear on autopilot -- and then clear
    # on the day it was telling them something. That argument is already in this repo twice
    # (#282, and the archive ceiling before it).

    # fact about this tree and drift there is a real finding. An open-issue count is a fact
    # about a website, and it is in the table for orientation. Drift in the issue column
    # ALONE is reported and exits 0; drift anywhere else still fails.

    # `--write` still refreshes everything, so the number is never wrong for long -- it just
    # stops being a reason to fail a push.
