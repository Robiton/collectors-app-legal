# Modified: 2026-08-31
# Version:  0.9.0.20260901.1930
# Purpose:  Cut a release that fails closed and leaves a receipt saying what was actually checked
# Changelog:
#   2026-09-01 v0.9.0.20260901.1930 — REGENERATES CHANGELOG.md AFTER TAGGING (#282), so the
#                        next commit does not land on a red gate. `changelog.sh --check`
#                        already tolerates the release moment -- HEAD carrying a tag the file
#                        predates is unavoidable -- but THAT TOLERANCE IS ONE COMMIT WIDE and
#                        closes the instant anything else is committed.
#                        MEASURED: three releases in one session, three `[FAIL] CHANGELOG.md
#                        matches the tags`, three `chore(changelog)` commits saying nothing a
#                        reader needs. A gate that fires predictably after a normal action,
#                        with a fixed one-command remedy and no decision in it, is one people
#                        clear on autopilot -- and then clear on the day it mattered.
#                        The file declares itself generated, so no judgement is taken from
#                        anyone. Committed, deliberately NOT pushed: pushing a branch is the
#                        releaser's call.
#   2026-08-31 v0.8.1.20260831.0904 — #250 the fixture set an identity per-commit but the SCRIPT UNDER TEST runs bare git tag -a,
#                        which needs its own -- exported now, so the fixture stops depending on ambient config.
#   2026-08-18 v0.8.0.20260819.0402 — Initial. Closes P0-7 (release receipts) and P0-8 (the
#                        release path must fail closed), which are one deliverable: a receipt
#                        nobody can trust is worse than none, and a release path that can
#                        proceed past a failed gate produces exactly that.
#                        A TAG IS NOT A RECEIPT. It records that someone typed a version. It
#                        does not say which SHA was tested, whether the gate ran or was
#                        merely skipped, what artifact was built, or on which platform.
#                        Every release cut here so far was `git tag` typed by hand after
#                        reading a summary line -- and on 2026-08-18 that exact habit pushed
#                        0.58.2 with preflight red, because a summary was read where an exit
#                        code should have been. This tool reads exit codes.
#                        FAILING CLOSED, CONCRETELY: no gate is ever piped into a formatter
#                        (the pipeline would report the formatter); every gate exit code is
#                        captured into a variable before anything is printed; BLOCKED (exit 3)
#                        is a refusal, not a pass, because "I could not check" must never
#                        read like "I checked"; and the tag is created only after every gate
#                        AND the receipt have succeeded, so a tag can never exist for a
#                        release whose evidence does not.
#                        RECEIPTS ARE NOT TRACKED, and that is forced rather than chosen: a
#                        receipt records the commit it describes, so committing it would
#                        produce a receipt filed under a SHA that is not the SHA it names.
#                        `.release-receipts/` is gitignored and the receipt is attached to
#                        the GitHub release, which is where it becomes immutable and
#                        fetchable by anyone asking what a given version was tested against.
