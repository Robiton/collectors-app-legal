# Purpose:  Tell an adopting project when the scaffold it vendored has gone stale.
# Changelog:
#   2026-09-06 v0.7.0.20260906.0406 — STALENESS IS DENOMINATED IN TIME, NOT RELEASES (#301).
#                        The gate failed at >1 release behind whatever the calendar said. On
#                        2026-09-04 this repo cut SIX releases in five hours, and an adopter
#                        who upgraded, did an hour of unrelated Kotlin, then tried to push was
#                        failed three times in one session by releases that landed WHILE THEY
#                        WORKED -- two of which replaced one product file and merged four
#                        standards files at +0 upstream lines. The risk being managed is "a fix
#                        has been available and you did not take it", which is a duration.
#                        So the COUNT opens the question and the AGE answers it: over the lag
#                        tolerance is a failure only once the oldest release not taken has been
#                        sitting there longer than RELEASE_AGE_TOLERANCE_DAYS.
#                        AGE UNKNOWN KEEPS THE OLD VERDICT. With no date we are exactly as
#                        informed as before this argument existed, so a missing fact must not
#                        manufacture leniency -- fixtured in both directions.
#                        The one-argument call is the backward-compatible contract, and a bare
#                        $2 under `set -u` turned it into an unbound-variable crash. The
#                        selftest caught that on its first run, which is the argument for
#                        having written the case before the code.
#   2026-08-31 v0.6.1.20260831.0904 — #249 mktemp -t is BSD-only -- bounded() returned 1 on its first line and never ran the
#                        command on Linux, so every gh call failed closed and a hang was not bounded at all.
#   2026-08-18 v0.6.0.20260818.1156 — `--assert-consistent`: THE ONE PLACE THE VERSION INVARIANT
#                        IS DEFINED (P0-2). It lived only in scaffold-check.yml, so it could
#                        not run on the machine that cuts the release -- and when Actions were
#                        blocked on 2026-08-13 it stopped running at all. `.scaffold-version`
#                        drifted FOURTEEN releases behind `version` in the upstream repo,
#                        where they are the same file and a fresh adoption inherits it as the
#                        merge base for its first --upgrade.
#                        setup.sh, preflight and the WORKFLOW now all call this rather than
#                        restating it. Reimplementing it locally would have been the wrong
#                        fix: two copies of one rule is this repo's most repeated defect.
#                        Three roles, and absence is never inferred -- upstream (must match),
#                        adoption (differ by design), no-artifact (must DECLARE it, and
#                        declaring both a version file and no-artifact is refused).
#                        Placed BELOW is_upstream_repo() after the first version died with
#                        `command not found` and took the ADOPTION branch upstream, printing
#                        the opposite of the truth -- the trap this file's 0.4.0 entry records.
#   2026-08-17 v0.5.2.20260817.1739 — #226 NAMED TWO UNBOUNDED CALLS AND 0.51.2 BOUNDED ONE. The
#                        one left is `gh release list` inside releases_behind() -- the call the
#                        GATE uses to count the lag, so the one that decides a verdict. I fixed
#                        the instance I had been looking at rather than the class the issue
#                        described, and the issue had been open the whole time. Reading the
#                        issue list before implementing would have cost nothing.
#                        SO THE CHECK IS NOW ON THE CLASS: every `gh` invocation in this file
#                        must be wrapped in bounded(), derived from the source, so the NEXT one
#                        added without a bound fails here instead of shipping. Mutation-verified
#                        both ways -- unbinding either call fails it.
#                        bounded() also MOVED above releases_behind(). Runtime-safe either way,
#                        but "defined below its caller" is the trap this file's own 0.4.0 entry
#                        records, and leaving a second instance of it in place was asking for it.
#   2026-08-17 v0.5.1.20260817.1636 — EVERY FETCH IN A GATE NEEDS A CEILING, and `gh` has no
#                        --max-time. 0.51.0 stopped --gate reading the cache, which was right,
#                        and thereby made every gated run depend on a live call -- so that
#                        call's worst case became the gate's worst case. curl was already
#                        bounded at 6s; gh was not, and gh is the PRIMARY path because the
#                        upstream repo is private and unauthenticated api.github.com 404s. An
#                        unbounded fetch inside preflight is a gate that HANGS instead of
#                        failing, which is worse than the stale answer 0.51.0 removed: a hang
#                        has no exit code to read. bounded() runs it in the background with a
#                        deadline and kills it, because neither `timeout` nor `gtimeout` ships
#                        with macOS and this runs on adopters' machines -- and with no process
#                        substitution, which segfaults bash 3.2 inside a loop. On timeout the
#                        curl fallback gets its own 6s, and if both are empty the existing
#                        branch reports exit 3 in gate mode. Asserted on the MECHANISM: a slow
#                        command returns 124, does so within 4s, and a fast one's stdout
#                        survives -- neither of which can pass vacuously, confirmed by
#                        mutation.
#   2026-08-17 v0.5.0.20260817.1505 — A GATE MAY CACHE THE COST OF A CHECK, NEVER ITS
#                        VERDICT. Measured on an adopter the day it was found: this repo
#                        shipped five releases, their 24h cache held 0.45.0 while 0.50.0 was
#                        current, and because their adopted 0.48.0 sorts ABOVE the stale
#                        0.45.0 the gate did not merely under-report -- it INVERTED the
#                        verdict into `[OK] ... tracking main` and passed. Their preflight
#                        passed on it all day, including the run immediately before a
#                        release. A 24-hour TTL on a gate, in a project releasing several
#                        times a day, is blind for most of the window it guards, and it is
#                        silent by construction because a stale value still looks like an
#                        answer. Shipped in 0.45.0, whose own title was "staleness is a gate
#                        now".
#                        THE TTL SURVIVES FOR THE ADVISORY PATH, which is what it was built
#                        for -- SessionStart costs nothing on a normal day and its verdict is
#                        a note. Under --gate the cache is not consulted at all; if the fetch
#                        then fails, the existing branch reports exit 3, could-not-run and
#                        NOT a pass, which is the answer a stale cache was concealing.
#                        cache_is_usable() IS SPLIT OUT so the decision has cases with no
#                        network in it -- and it went in BELOW the selftest first, where
#                        three of its four cases passed against `command not found`, because
#                        a missing function is falsy and they expected "no". Only the
#                        positive case failed. That is the trap the 0.4.0 entry below already
#                        records, repeated in the same file it is written in.
#   2026-08-16 v0.4.0.20260816.1916 — `--gate`: THIS CHECK HAD NO CALLER.
#                        It has exited 1 on "behind" since it was written, and preflight
#                        ran only its --selftest -- proving the check works while never
#                        running it. A declaration nothing reads, in the file whose entire
#                        subject is a stale copy looking identical to a current one.
#                        MEASURED THE DAY IT WAS FOUND: localcoder sat two releases behind,
#                        and the newer release was the one titled "the stamp gate had the
#                        defect it was built to catch" -- so the fix for a defect an adopter
#                        reported never reached the adopter, and four releases were cut past
#                        the warning that said so.
#                        ONE RELEASE OF TOLERANCE, then it fails. Upstream cutting a release
#                        must not redden every adopter the same afternoon; a gate that
#                        reddens on somebody else's schedule is one people push past, and
#                        this estate has already measured that cost. Two behind is a
#                        different claim: a fix was available through a full release nobody
#                        took.
#                        count_newer IS SPLIT FROM THE FETCH so the ordering logic has cases
#                        on it without a network, and it carries the same numeric-not-string
#                        compare as the rest of this file -- as text "0.10" < "0.5", which
#                        would report a current repo nine releases behind and fail its gate.
#                        UNDETERMINABLE IS 3, NEVER 0: offline and current are identical
#                        from here, and only one of them is a pass.
#                        THE HELPERS SIT ABOVE THE SELFTEST DELIBERATELY. Written below it
#                        first, every case errored `command not found` -- and one PASSED
#                        anyway, because a missing function returns empty and the expected
#                        value was empty. A case that passes because the code is absent.
#   2026-08-08 v0.3.1 — Same re-fetch fix as scaffold_upgrade.sh (#136): gh api, quoted,
#                        plus a `head -1` check, because the failure mode is a file that
#                        exists and is wrong rather than an error.
#   2026-08-08 v0.3.0 — The upstream repo is not BEHIND, it is the thing compared TO (#134).
#                        `.scaffold-version` is advanced only by scaffold_upgrade.sh, which
#                        correctly refuses to run in the scaffold's own repository — so the
#                        file can never move there. It sat at 0.8.0.20260805.1400 through
#                        three releases while `version` read 0.11.3, and this printed BEHIND
#                        at every session start, in the repo whose maintainer reads it most.
#                        This file already warned that a wrong BEHIND is "the fastest way to
#                        teach people to ignore a version check"; it was doing that to
#                        itself. All three signals, per #113 — a mirroring sibling and a
#                        template clone are both real adoptions and must still be told.
#   2026-08-08 v0.2.0 — Say when the UPGRADE TOOL ITSELF is too old to fix being behind
#                        (#130). `setup.sh --upgrade` delegates to the vendored
#                        tools/scaffold_upgrade.sh, so a defect in that script's
#                        preconditions cannot be repaired by upgrading — the fix ships
#                        inside the thing that refuses to run. Robiton/localcoder carried
#                        0.3.2, whose scaffold's-own-repo check keyed on mirror-sync.yml
#                        alone; that repo mirrors, so every attempt died with "There is
#                        nothing to upgrade here", which reads as SUCCESS. It sat 13
#                        releases behind while the fix sat upstream. "Behind" and "cannot
#                        become current" were indistinguishable from inside the repo,
#                        which is precisely what this script exists to make visible.
#                        Floor is DECLARED (0.5.0), not fetched: deriving it would need a
#                        second network call on a session-start check and would still be
#                        silent offline. Comparison extracted as a pure function with a
#                        --selftest this script never had — including 0.10.0 vs 0.5.0,
#                        where a string compare says "behind" and would send a current
#                        adopter at a curl command they do not need.
#   2026-08-04 v0.1.0 — Initial creation
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#   Updating is a manual clone-and-diff and nothing in an adopting repo ever said
#   "you are behind". sync-check.sh checks a lot — pointer health, skills drift, ai/
#   commits on the remote, the archive threshold — but every one of those compares the
#   project against ITS OWN origin. None compared the vendored scaffold against upstream.
#
#   Measured: one project sat on v0.2.0 for FOUR MONTHS, through a v0.3.0 update that
#   did not land cleanly, and nobody knew. It surfaced only because a human asked
#   "update the scaffold" out of the blue; upstream was on v0.5.0 by then. Nothing was
#   broken enough to notice, which is the whole problem — a silently stale scaffold
#   looks identical to a current one from inside the repo.
#
# DESIGN NOTES
#   - Reads .scaffold-version, NOT `version`. Those were the same file, and `version`
#     usually holds the adopter's project version, so a human who thought to look was
#     reading the wrong number entirely.
#   - Result is CACHED (24h) so the SessionStart path costs nothing on a normal day.
#   - Degrades SILENTLY offline. A version check that nags when you are on a plane is
#     one people disable, and then it protects nobody.
#
# Usage:
#   tools/scaffold_version.sh              # cached check; silent when current
#   tools/scaffold_version.sh --force      # ignore the cache
#   tools/scaffold_version.sh --quiet      # exit code only (0 current/unknown, 1 behind)

# HOW FAR BEHIND IS TOO FAR. One release of slack, deliberately: upstream cutting a release
# must not turn every adopter red the same afternoon, because a gate that reddens on
# somebody else's schedule is one people learn to push past -- and this repo has already
# measured what that costs (a 297s gate taught everyone here to use --no-verify).
# Two or more releases behind is a different claim: at that point a fix has been available

# ...AND THE COUNT ALONE IS THE WRONG DENOMINATOR (#301). The paragraph above is right about

# to push was failed three times in one session by releases that landed WHILE THEY WORKED.
# Two of those upgrades replaced one product file and merged four standards files at +0
# upstream lines -- scored identically to a six-release jump that genuinely mattered.
#
# The risk being managed is "a fix has been available and you did not take it", and that is
# denominated in TIME. So the count opens the question and the age answers it: over the lag
# tolerance is only a FAILURE once the oldest release you skipped has been sitting there
# longer than this. A burst is reported and passes; genuine neglect still fails.

# BEING BEHIND IS ONLY HALF THE STORY: THE TOOL THAT FIXES IT CAN BE TOO OLD TO RUN (#130).
#
# `setup.sh --upgrade` delegates to the VENDORED tools/scaffold_upgrade.sh, so a defect in
# that script's preconditions cannot be repaired by upgrading — the fix ships inside the
# thing that refuses to run. Measured on Robiton/localcoder: it carried 0.3.2, whose
# scaffold's-own-repo check keyed on .github/workflows/mirror-sync.yml ALONE. That repo
# mirrors, so every upgrade attempt died with "There is nothing to upgrade here", which
# reads as SUCCESS. It sat 13 releases behind while the fix (0.5.0) sat upstream, reachable
# only by a command nobody had a reason to run.
#
# Nothing detected it, because "behind" and "cannot become current" looked identical from
# inside the repo — which is the exact thing this script exists to say out loud.
#
# The floor is DECLARED, not derived. Comparing against upstream's copy of the file would
# need a second network fetch on a session-start check, and would still be silent offline.
# 0.5.0 is where the three-signal precondition landed; below it, a sibling product repo is
# refused outright and no adopter can be sure their copy is not the stranded shape.
UPGRADE_TOOL_FLOOR="0.5.0"

# PURE, so the floor can be tested without a repo, a network or a stranded clone. The
# behaviour this guards was unobservable for 13 releases; a check for it that is itself
# unverifiable would be no better.
# Prints "yes" when $1 is older than $2. Empty or unparseable -> "no": unknown is not stale.

# THE ONE PLACE THIS INVARIANT IS DEFINED. It lived only in scaffold-check.yml, so it could
# not run on the machine that cuts the release — and when Actions were blocked by billing on
# 2026-08-13 it stopped running at all. `.scaffold-version` then drifted FOURTEEN releases
# behind `version` in the upstream repo, where the two are the same file, and every fresh
# adoption inherited a merge base from fourteen releases back. Turning CI on again would have
# failed the first run.
#
# The workflow now CALLS THIS rather than reproducing it. That distinction is the whole point
# and it was the reviewer's, not mine: a local reimplementation of what the workflow does is
# not one rule enforced twice, it is two rules that will disagree — which is this project's
# single most repeated defect.
#
# TWO REPOSITORY ROLES, AND ABSENCE IS NEVER INFERRED:
#   upstream product   `.scaffold-version` MUST equal `version` — they are the same release,
#                      and `.scaffold-version` ships into a fresh adoption as its merge base.
#   adoption           they differ BY DESIGN: `version` is the adopter's product,
#                      `.scaffold-version` is the scaffold release they run. Nothing to assert.
#   no-artifact repo   no `version` at all, and it must SAY so via scaffold:no-artifact.

# otherwise. One value, one comparison, one verdict.
#
# A GATE MAY CACHE THE COST OF A CHECK, NEVER ITS VERDICT. Measured 2026-08-17: this repo
# shipped five releases in a day, an adopter's cache held 0.45.0 while 0.50.0 was current,
# and because their adopted 0.48.0 sorts ABOVE the stale 0.45.0 the gate did not merely
# under-report -- it INVERTED the verdict into `[OK] ... tracking main` and passed. Their
# preflight passed on it all day, including the run before a release. A 24-hour TTL on a
# gate in a project that releases several times a day is blind for most of the window it
# guards, and the failure is silent by construction because a stale value still looks like
# an answer.
#
# So the TTL survives for the advisory SessionStart path, which is what it was built for --
# that path costs nothing on a normal day and its verdict is a note, not a gate. Under
# --gate the cache is not consulted at all. If the fetch then fails, the branch below
# reports exit 3 (could-not-run, NOT a pass), which is the honest answer an offline gate
# owes and the one a stale cache was concealing.
