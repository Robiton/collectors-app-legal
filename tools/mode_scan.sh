# Modified: 2026-08-11
# Version:  0.3.0.20260818.2135
# Purpose:  Fail while a tracked file's mode disagrees with its shebang — a tool at 644 stops running.
# Changelog:
#   2026-08-18 v0.3.0.20260818.2135 — --fix, because the hint was not enough. This scanner
#                        caught the same defect FOUR times in one session: a new tool
#                        arrives from an upgrade, `git add` records it 644 because
#                        core.fileMode is false, and the suite it ships silently never
#                        runs. Every time the message named the exact command, and every
#                        time it was one file at a time. A remedy that scales with the
#                        number of findings is one people batch and then forget.
#                        It applies the SAME `git update-index` the message prints, to the
#                        INDEX only -- the working tree is never touched, so `git diff
#                        --cached` shows exactly what changed before you commit it.
#                        Two cases, both halves: --fix must repair the mode, and the PLAIN
#                        scan must still change nothing. A gate that quietly mutates the
#                        repository it is judging is worse than the defect.
#   2026-08-11 v0.2.0 — Catches skip-worktree and assume-unchanged (#D-10). Same defect
#                        class as the mode bit and that is why it lives here: git's record
#                        disagrees with the disk and nothing on screen says so. The mode bit
#                        makes a tool stop running; these make git stop LOOKING.
#                        MEASURED here 2026-08-11: ai/eval_tasks.py carried the bit with 14
#                        tasks on disk and 2 in HEAD, while the scaffold published pass@1
#                        scores measured against the 14. Anyone cloning got numbers they
#                        could not reproduce, and two people spent a review round measuring
#                        different things without either being wrong.
#                        Three cases, including the negative one: a scan that flagged every
#                        repository would be switched off, and most have nothing hidden.
#   2026-08-09 v0.1.0 — New, extracted from .github/workflows/scaffold-check.yml (#166).
#                        THIS RULE HAS NOW CAUGHT THE SAME MISTAKE THREE TIMES, AND EVERY
#                        TIME IT CAUGHT IT REMOTELY. tools/conflict_scan.sh landed as 644
#                        and its 15 new cases did not run while CI printed "12 tool selftest
#                        suite(s) passed" in green; tools/preflight.sh and
#                        tools/lint_python.sh did exactly the same thing on the PR that
#                        introduced the local pre-push gate — a gate that could not catch the
#                        defect in itself, because it ran the selftests off the FILESYSTEM
#                        mode while git records its own.
#                        That is the whole reason this is a file now. As inline shell in a
#                        `run:` block it could only ever run in CI. As tools/*_scan.sh it is
#                        discovered by `setup.sh --check`, by `tools/preflight.sh` and by the
#                        workflow, with no edit to any of them — and it has a selftest.
#                        `git config core.fileMode false` is the setting that makes this
#                        invisible locally, and it is the CORRECT setting on a filesystem
#                        that reports 0700 for everything (this repo lives on one). So the
#                        index is what gets asked, never the working tree.

# WHOSE FILES ARE IN SCOPE.
#
# In the upstream scaffold: every tracked file. The scaffold SHIPS its own modes, so a wrong
# one is a product defect — measured 2026-08-08, 45 of 92 tracked files were 755 with no
# shebang, including every ai/*.md, LICENSE and a .png, because this repo lives on a
# OneDrive-backed path that reports 0700 for everything.
#
# In an ADOPTION: only files whose header says the scaffold wrote them. Failing an adopter's
# build over a mode bit on THEIR file would be #76 again — their files, their call, possibly
# a mode we gave them. But a VENDORED tool that lost its +x is a tool that silently stopped
# running in their project too, and that they do want to know. Same ownership question
# tools/lint_python.sh asks, answered the same way: ask the file.

  # produces different ones — and two people spent a review round measuring different things
  # without either being wrong. It had been set for days and `git status` never mentioned it.
  #
  # `git ls-files -v` prefixes each path with a tag: H is normal, S is skip-worktree, and a
