# Modified: 2026-09-09
# Version:  0.5.0.20260909.0522
# Purpose:  ONE list of what an adoption receives from the scaffold, and a check that the
#           four places which restate that list still agree with it.
# Changelog:
#   2026-09-09 v0.5.0.20260909.0522 — docs/ IS DELIVERED NOW, and the exemption that hid that goes with it.
#                        The manifest has declared docs/ since it was written and NOTHING ever
#                        copied it: the guide's step 3 did not, the headless path did not, and
#                        both were EXEMPTED here with a reason -- so the check passed while
#                        three real adoptions had no docs/ directory at all. A declared path
#                        that reaches nobody is the exact failure this tool was built for, and
#                        it was carrying a written-down exception for it.
#                        Step 3 copies docs/; the headless path fetches the markdown and skips
#                        the two images and the .docx deliberately. Both exemptions removed,
#                        and the stale-exemption guard fired on the first of them immediately,
#                        which is why the second was found rather than left.
#                        docs/AGENT_RUNBOOK.md is the reason this mattered: it is written so an
#                        AGENT can set up an adoption without reading the 1,200-line guide, and
#                        it reached no adoption.
#                        The selftest fixture restated the same two exemptions and had to move
#                        with them -- a fixture honouring a rule the tool no longer has is a
#                        fixture asserting the old behaviour.
#   2026-09-08 v0.4.0.20260908.0528 — adopt.ps1 joins the manifest. Adding one root file walked
#                        through all FOUR delivery lists in sequence -- upgrade, guide,
#                        headless -- refusing each time until they agreed. That is the
#                        tool doing precisely what it was built for.
#   2026-09-04 v0.3.0.20260904.0710 — BOTH ADOPTION PATHS ARE CHECKED NOW (#303). The guide has two — step 3
#                        clones and copies, "Headless Linux" fetches over gh api for a machine
#                        that cannot clone — and they were maintained as two separate lists.
#                        Measured by EXECUTING the headless block: it never fetched setup.sh at
#                        all, so an SSH-only adopter could not run the ./setup.sh --check that
#                        the same section tells them to run next; it never stripped
#                        scaffold:session-log, so the step-3 fix shipped an hour earlier left
#                        this path still hard-failing exit 4; and .agents/ and .cursor/ were
#                        missing outright. Step 3 was bitten by the setup.sh omission on
#                        2026-08-31 and fixed; the parallel path was never given the line.
#   2026-09-04 v0.2.0.20260904.0558 — THE REVERSE CHECK: what does the scaffold own that nobody declared? (#300)
#                        Everything here checked that DECLARED paths are delivered consistently.
#                        It could not see a file on no list at all — which is exactly how
#                        `.gitleaks.toml` hid. That file was written 2026-08-30 to suppress the
#                        12 synthetic fixtures in tools/secret_scan.sh that every adopter
#                        vendors; its own header records the measurement. It was correct,
#                        argued, committed — and reached NOBODY. Five weeks later a fleet sweep
#                        re-measured the identical 12 findings in eight repositories. Every
#                        tracked root file is now declared or exempted with a reason.
#   2026-09-03 v0.1.1.20260903.1929 — --selftest ASSERTS THE TOOL, NOT THE REPO, and `check` has three outcomes.
#                        The first version mutated a copy of the LIVE tree, so in an adopter
#                        (no docs/ADOPTION_GUIDE.md) `cp` failed and every adopter went red on
#                        the upgrade that delivered this file. The mutations now run against a
#                        synthetic three-file fixture this function builds. `check` returns 3
#                        — NOT MEASURED — where the four restatements it compares do not exist,
#                        which is neither a pass nor a failure. Both rules were already
#                        written down here; the tool that exists to stop lists drifting broke
#                        them on its first release.
#   2026-09-03 v0.1.0.20260903.1853 — Initial (#291, #294, #297). The manifest existed in four
#                        places and no two were checked against each other, so a FRESH
#                        adoption and an UPGRADE delivered different file sets. Found by an
#                        outside reviewer reading a real adoption, not by anything here.
#
# THE FOUR COPIES, and what each one is for:
#
#   1. docs/ADOPTION_GUIDE.md step 3   — what a human copies for a FRESH adoption.
#   2. PRODUCT_FILES / PRODUCT_DIRS_*  — what scaffold_upgrade.sh refreshes on an UPGRADE.
#   3. build.sh (splunk-app overlay)   — what must NOT go into a deployment artifact.
#   4. tools/adoption_check.sh         — what the fixtures build.
#
# Measured drift at 0.88.3, all three found by an external review of one real adoption:
#   - `.githooks/` was in (2) and absent from (1): 18 occurrences vs 0. A fresh adoption
#     never received it and never would until its first upgrade.
#   - build.sh excluded 6 of 20 (#291), so a CORRECTLY BUILT Splunk package shipped tools/,
#     .claude/, .github/ and setup.sh to a production host. The reviewer read that list as
#     "complete and correct" — it excludes ai/, which is what makes it read as considered.
#   - ai/PROVENANCE.md and ai/STANDARDS_EVIDENCE.md were in (1) via `cp -r ai .` (#293).
#
# WHY A SCRIPT AND NOT A DERIVED LIST. Deriving "everything the scaffold owns" from the
# tree would silently start shipping whatever lands in it next, and an inferred list that
# comes back empty stops every adopter receiving anything — the failure mode
# scaffold_upgrade.sh already writes about at PRODUCT_FILES. So: declared here, once, and
# --check asserts the restatements match. Adding a file is one line and one failing check.

#
# `version` is deliberately absent: that file is the ADOPTER's, and the guide says so.

# inside a single document.
#
# Measured, by executing the headless block rather than reading it: it never fetched
# `setup.sh` AT ALL, so a headless adopter could not run the `./setup.sh --check` that the
# same section tells them to run next; it never stripped `scaffold:session-log`, so the fix
# that went into step 3 an hour earlier left this path still hard-failing exit 4; and its
# hand-written ai/ list had gone stale by three files. Step 3 had already been bitten by the
# setup.sh omission on 2026-08-31 and fixed; the parallel path was never given the same line.
#
# So both are checked. A path satisfied by one and not the other is the bug.
