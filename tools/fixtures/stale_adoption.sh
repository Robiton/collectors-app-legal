# Modified: 2026-09-06
# Version:  0.1.1.20260906.0554
# Purpose:  The shape that found five defects in one day — a pre-tools/ adoption with a
#           legacy CLAUDE.md symlink, a camelCase codebase and a build tool that rewrites
#           tracked files — rebuilt synthetically so it stops being an anecdote.
# Changelog:
#   2026-09-06 v0.1.1.20260906.0554 — Dropped a manufactured issue citation. "Initial (#307)" pointed at
#                        a number that was never filed; the WHY section below already says
#                        why this exists, so the citation was inventing a reference rather
#                        than making one.
#   2026-09-04 v0.1.0.20260904.0938 — Initial. The stale-adoption shape, rebuilt synthetically; see WHY THIS EXISTS below. No issue: this fixture records a shape, not a defect with a fix.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS.
#
# On 2026-09-04 three sessions ran the adoption guide against real repositories and found
# ten defects. Nine of them were invisible to every gate in this repository, and five came
# from ONE repo whose shape nothing here reproduced: an adoption predating tools/, still
# carrying the <=v0.3.0 CLAUDE.md symlink, in a camelCase codebase, with a directory a build
# tool regenerates. Each of those properties found something.
#
# That repo is a private application. This file rebuilds the SHAPE with none of its content.
#
# WHAT IT IS NOT. It is not part of adoption_check.sh, deliberately: that file builds its
# fixture from the CURRENT repo and inherits its state, which is its own open defect. This
# one owns its tree from the first commit, because two of the six properties need real git
# history and one needs a change with NO commit behind it.
#
# Needs no network and no Ollama. Runs on either runner.
