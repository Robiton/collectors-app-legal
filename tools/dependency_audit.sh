# Version:  0.3.0.20260830.1627
# Purpose:  Known vulnerabilities in the dependencies we actually declare — the one class a
#           scanner genuinely owns, reported so that "nothing found" and "nothing ran" can
#           never print the same way.
# Changelog:
#   2026-08-30 v0.3.0.PENDING — TWO REGISTRIES, AND A SUMMARY THAT CANNOT ROUND UP. Staleness
#                        asked repo1.maven.org only; AndroidX does not publish to Central, so
#                        every androidx.* coordinate 404'd -- 4 of health-app's 7, the only repo
#                        here with a real dependency tree. kotlinx is the reverse case (Central
#                        200, Google 404), so both are genuinely required. Central first, Google
#                        on a miss, and the line now NAMES the registry that answered instead of
#                        asserting Central. Second and worse: those 4 [??] lines printed directly
#                        above "7 direct coordinate(s) clean" at rc 0 -- this file says a skip is
#                        not a pass in four places and then contradicted the four lines above it.
#                        staleness_line returns 2 when currency was not established, catalog_audit
#                        counts them, the summary refuses "clean" while any are outstanding. The
#                        EXIT CODE DOES NOT MOVE: staleness is not a vulnerability, a [..] line
#                        already never affects rc, and a registry hiccup must not fail builds.
#                        8 new selftests (26 total), one stubbing curl so every registry misses.
#   2026-08-30 v0.2.2.PENDING — `tail -1` PICKED A COMPAT VARIANT over the version it varies:
#                        kotlinx-datetime's list ends 0.8.0 then 0.8.0-0.6.x-compat, so "newest
#                        stable" was the compat artifact. Prefer a plain numeric version, fall
#                        back for artifacts like voyager that publish no plain form.
#   2026-08-30 v0.2.1.20260830.0719 — STALENESS FAIL-SILENT FIXED. An empty `latest` meant both
#                        "nothing newer" and "the lookup did not happen", and the guard read both as
#                        up to date. Observed live: three of four probes returned nothing on one run
#                        and everything on the next. Split into staleness_line() so the failure
#                        branches are testable without a network; 4 planted cases added.
#   2026-08-30 v0.2.0.20260830.0620 — VERSION-CATALOG MODE, which is the answer to "osv-scanner needs a
#                        lockfile and we have none". osv.dev answers by COORDINATE over HTTP,
#                        and a Gradle version catalog already names exact coordinates -- so the
#                        direct dependencies are auditable today, with no lockfile anywhere.
#                        Verified end to end against health-app's real catalog (7 coordinates,
#                        clean) and against a planted jackson-databind 2.9.8 (55 advisories),
#                        so a zero here is a real zero and not a broken request.
#                        HONEST ABOUT THE GAP: a catalog names DIRECT dependencies only. Most
#                        CVEs arrive transitively. This COMPLEMENTS dependency locking and
#                        stops being the best available answer the moment a lockfile exists.
#                        Staleness comes from maven-metadata.xml -- the artifact registry, not
#                        the source host -- with pre-releases filtered, because the first run
#                        told health-app it was behind an RC its own catalog says it refuses.
#   2026-08-30 v0.1.0 — Initial. Written after a week in which SEVEN real defects were found
#                        and an off-the-shelf shell linter would have caught NONE of them
#                        (tested against reproductions, not assumed). The conclusion was not
#                        "scanners are useless" but "scanners own exactly one class, and it is
#                        not the class we keep hitting". This is that one class.
#
# WHY THIS REPORTS "NOTHING TO SCAN" AS ITS OWN STATE
#
#   At the time of writing, an OSV scan of this repository finds nothing — not because the
#   dependencies are clean but because THERE ARE NONE. The scaffold declares no runtime
#   dependency and localcoder ships `dependencies = []` on purpose. A tool that printed a
#   green tick for that would be manufacturing assurance out of an empty set, and this
#   programme has been bitten by exactly that shape before: `ci_status.sh` reported no alerts
#   for months in three repositories where every alert feature was switched off, because zero
#   and not-enabled print identically if you only look for a number.
#
#   So there are three outcomes and they are not collapsed:
#     rc 0  scanned, and found nothing
#     rc 1  scanned, and found something          (only --strict turns this into a failure)
#     rc 3  DID NOT SCAN — no lockfile, or no scanner. Never reported as a pass.
#
# THE PREREQUISITE IS A LOCKFILE, NOT THIS SCRIPT
#
#   OSV reads Java through `gradle.lockfile`, `gradle/verification-metadata.xml` or
#   `pom.xml`. Gradle dependency locking is OPT-IN. Robiton/health-app -- the first project
#   here with a real dependency tree, and the one intended to be sold -- has none of those
#   files and has not enabled locking, so this script would scan an empty set in the only
#   repository where it currently matters. Enabling locking is the actual first move; this
#   script is what makes it pay off. It says so, out loud, rather than going green.

# THE ANSWER TO "OSV-SCANNER NEEDS A LOCKFILE AND WE HAVE NONE".
#
# osv-scanner reads lockfiles. Gradle dependency locking is opt-in, health-app has not enabled
# it, and every other repository here declares no dependencies at all -- so the scanner path
# reports "nothing to scan" in the one place it matters. That is honest and useless.
#
# A Gradle VERSION CATALOG already names exact coordinates, and osv.dev answers queries by
# coordinate over HTTP with no lockfile anywhere:
#     POST https://api.osv.dev/v1/query  {"package":{"name":"g:a","ecosystem":"Maven"},"version":"1.2.3"}
# Verified against a known-bad artifact before this was written: jackson-databind 2.9.8
# returns 55 advisories, so a zero here is a real zero and not a broken request.
#
# WHAT THIS DOES NOT COVER, said plainly because the gap is the whole reason lockfiles exist:
# a catalog names DIRECT, CHOSEN dependencies. It says nothing about the transitive tree
# beneath them, and most real CVEs arrive transitively. This is a COMPLEMENT to locking, not a
# replacement -- it is what can be checked today, and it stops being the best available answer
# the moment a lockfile exists.

# a project is current. A SKIP IS NOT A PASS, which this file already says in three other
# places about the scan and did not say about the staleness line.
# RETURNS 2 WHEN STALENESS WAS NOT DETERMINED, 0 WHEN IT WAS. The caller counts the 2s and
# the summary refuses to say "clean" if any came back. Before this, an unchecked coordinate
# printed [??] on its own line and then vanished from the total -- per-item honesty that did
# not survive into the aggregate, which is the same defect as a green tick one level up.

  # PICKING "NEWEST" NEEDS A COMPARISON, NOT A SHAPE TEST. Two wrong answers got here first,
  # both the same error -- something correlated with newest, substituted for newest:
  #
  #   `tail -1` (document order)  -> kotlinx-datetime ends 0.8.0 then 0.8.0-0.6.x-compat, and
  #                                  the COMPAT VARIANT of 0.8.0 was reported as newer than it.
  #                                  Maven's own <release> says the same wrong thing.
  #   "prefer a plain numeric"    -> my fix for the above. It then picked voyager's stale 1.0.1
  #                                  over 2.2.21-1.10.3, because voyager's current line is
  #                                  hyphenated (the suffix is the Compose version) and its
  #                                  plain-numeric releases are two years old. Caught by running
  #                                  it against real coordinates rather than by the selftests.
  #
  # So: compare the LEADING NUMERIC CORE numerically, and use the suffix only to break a tie --
  # where a bare version beats a suffixed one carrying the same core. That gets all three real
  # shapes right: 0.8.0 over 0.8.0-0.6.x-compat, 2.2.21-1.10.3 over 1.0.1, and 7.0.9 for a
  # project whose newest publish is a filtered milestone.
