# Modified: 2026-09-08
# Version:  0.24.2.20260908.0528
# Purpose:  Upgrade an adopting project from the scaffold release it is on to a newer one.
# Changelog:
#   2026-09-08 v0.24.2.20260908.0528 — adopt.ps1 joins PRODUCT_FILES, so a Windows adopter's copy
#                        is refreshed on upgrade rather than frozen at whatever version
#                        they first copied.
#   2026-09-06 v0.24.1.20260906.0600 — The fifth site cited #306, a number that was never filed. Now
#                        points at #303, which exists and tracks the residual: an adoption
#                        that never upgrades keeps the instruction and the scaffold has no
#                        reach into it. Two sites, not one -- the changelog and the function.
#   2026-09-04 v0.24.0.20260904.0928 — mig_agents_symlink_instruction — THE FIFTH SITE, and the only one that
#                        cannot be closed from this repository (#303). <=v0.3.0 shipped an
#                        AGENTS.md telling the reader `ln -s AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md`. AGENTS.md is
#                        a MERGE file, so that paragraph survives every upgrade indefinitely —
#                        mig_claude_gitignore repairs the artefact and leaves the instruction
#                        that recreates it. An adopter who upgrades and then follows their own
#                        AGENTS.md walks straight back into the truncation. Surgical: only the
#                        two unambiguous <=v0.3.0 lines are rewritten, prose is untouched, and
#                        AGENTS.md.scaffold-backup is kept.
#   2026-09-04 v0.23.2.20260904.0558 — .gitleaks.toml joins PRODUCT_FILES (#300) — the allowlist that makes
#                        the shipped secret scanner usable never shipped with it.
#   2026-09-04 v0.23.1.20260904.0243 — .github/CONTRIBUTING.md JOINS MERGE_FILES (#298). It sidecarred on three
#                        consecutive upgrades in localcoder with an identical diff — three
#                        release-checklist rows that repo legitimately owns. The mechanism was
#                        working; it was just asking the same question every release and
#                        getting the same answer. A checklist both sides extend is what a
#                        three-way merge is for. Same move AGENTS.md made, same reason.
#   2026-09-03 v0.23.0.20260903.1906 — .claude/ AND .agents/ ARE DELIVERED ON UPGRADE (#291). Neither directory was
#                       touched by an upgrade at all, so every hook fix this project has
#                       shipped — the PreCompact hook, the --wire fix, the un-silencing of the
#                       session hook, all of 0.88.x — reached exactly ZERO adopters through an
#                       upgrade. Found by tools/adoption_manifest.sh --check, which is the
#                       first thing to compare what an adoption RECEIVES against what an
#                       upgrade REFRESHES. `.claude/settings.json` is deliberately still not
#                       delivered: it is the adopter's own config. The canonical
#                       settings.hooks.json is, so `setup.sh --check` reports the delta.
#   2026-09-02 v0.22.0.20260902.0517 — ai/OPERATIONS.md JOINS MERGE_FILES (#281). It carries
#                        the reference half of the standards and ai/STANDARDS.md now points at
#                        it eleven times, so shipping one without the other repeats #280
#                        exactly: pointers with no file behind them, invisible to every check
#                        that reads only the upstream tree. Merged rather than force-installed
#                        for the same reason as STANDARDS_EVIDENCE.md -- an adopter will want
#                        to append their own operational notes.
#   2026-09-01 v0.21.2.20260901.1845 — DELIVERED HOOKS ARRIVE EXECUTABLE IN THE INDEX, not
#                        only on the filesystem (#283). `core.fileMode` is false in every
#                        working copy here, so `chmod +x` is invisible to git: the file runs
#                        on the machine that upgraded and is committed 644, and the next
#                        clone gets a hook git silently never runs.
#                        MEASURED: 0.84.0 delivered the three chaining git-lfs hooks to
#                        Robiton/localcoder and mode_scan.sh reported all three [DEAD] on the
#                        first preflight after the upgrade. `git update-index --chmod=+x`
#                        now runs beside the chmod.
#                        THE FIXTURE MISSED IT BECAUSE IT ASSERTED THE WRONG PROPERTY -- the
#                        filesystem bit, when the thing that ships is the index bit. The
#                        matching case now reads `git ls-files -s`. Same class as most of
#                        what this file has ever caught: a check measuring the correlate.
#   2026-09-01 v0.21.1.20260901.1751 — ai/STANDARDS_EVIDENCE.md JOINS MERGE_FILES (#280).
#                        0.84.0 moved the story behind eighteen rules out of ai/STANDARDS.md
#                        and left the pointers in. The new file was on no delivery list, so
#                        the first adopter upgraded to nineteen dangling cross-references and
#                        no file behind them. Caught by upgrading Robiton/localcoder, not by
#                        a fixture: a file that ships to nobody is invisible to every check
#                        that reads only the upstream tree.
#                        MERGED, NOT FORCE-INSTALLED. It is upstream reference material an
#                        adopter will want to append their own evidence to, which is exactly
#                        what the three-way merge is for.
#   2026-09-01 v0.21.0.20260901.1656 — SHIPS THE THREE CHAINING git-lfs HOOKS (#274), and
#                        stops swallowing two verdicts (#277).
#                        core.hooksPath is EXCLUSIVE: setting it disables .git/hooks
#                        entirely, and git-lfs installs post-checkout, post-commit and
#                        post-merge there and announces none of them. Upstreamed from
#                        Robiton/godsfall#146, where that repository had already paid the
#                        bill once -- 377 broken pointer files across every clone. They CHAIN
#                        rather than copy, so git-lfs keeps one implementation, and they are
#                        on PRODUCT_FILES so an adopter receives them without being asked.
#                        The fixture asserts all three arrive EXECUTABLE: core.fileMode is
#                        false in these working copies, and a 644 hook is one git silently
#                        never runs.
#                        A FAILING skills_check PRINTED NOTHING AT ALL. The `&&` chain meant
#                        in-sync said so and out-of-sync said nothing -- indistinguishable
#                        from the tool being absent, the exact pair this package refuses to
#                        conflate everywhere else. And header_check's "reported problems --
#                        run it" now prints what it found, on the one branch that has it.
#   2026-08-31 v0.20.1.20260831.1416 — ONE SHA PER PATH WAS WRONG (#255), and the message that went with it
#                        made a claim about the adopter that was not true. A retired file
#                        changes over its shipped life; recording only the LAST revision told
#                        every adopter on an earlier one that they had EDITED it -- and the
#                        adopters most likely to be on an older revision are the ones who
#                        carried the file longest, which is the backlog the manifest exists to
#                        clear. Measured: install_ollama_service.sh shipped in FOUR revisions.
#                        Now: every shipped sha, any may match.
#                        AND THE WORDING. Manifest removals cited "$FROM_TAG", a baseline that
#                        by definition never held the file, and the kept message said the
#                        adopter had edited it. Someone who knows they did not was left
#                        working out which half of the sentence was wrong. Manifest removals
#                        now explain themselves by what the scaffold shipped, and a kept file
#                        is described without any claim about what its owner did.
#   2026-08-31 v0.20.0.20260831.1327 — TWO DEFECTS FROM ONE ADOPTER, BOTH IN CODE SHIPPED HOURS EARLIER.
#                        #254 SECURITY: a comment after a line continuation ended the command,
#                        so `env` ran with NO COMMAND and printed the whole environment -- any
#                        ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, GITHUB_TOKEN or AWS_* in it, into a log that
#                        outlives the run, from a repo that ships secret_scan.sh. The same
#                        typo silently dropped the two variables the handover exists to pass.
#                        #253: the BASE-vs-NEW diff added in 0.19.2 is blind by construction to
#                        anything retired BEFORE the adopter's baseline -- it is in neither
#                        tree, so it reads as adopter-added. Measured: the two files that
#                        MOTIVATED that fix survived a real 0.38.3 -> 0.82.2 upgrade.
#                        tools/RETIRED.tsv now carries path + sha256-as-last-shipped, so
#                        removal is safe without a tree to compare against. And the dry run
#                        previews it: a removal nobody can preview is one nobody can refuse.
#   2026-08-31 v0.19.2.20260831.0904 — #252 files upstream RETIRED were never removed -- 0.38->0.82 left two behind. The baseline is
#                        the discriminator; an edited retired file is kept and named, never deleted.
#   2026-08-30 v0.19.1.20260830.0927 — THE EXCLUSION GUARD HAD SILENTLY STOPPED EXCLUDING, and said so
#                        100+ times per upgrade in a message nobody connected to it.
#                        OWNS_LOCALCODER_PATHS was emptied deliberately months ago; the line
#                        appending it to PRODUCT_PATH_EXCLUDE was not removed with it, leaving
#                        a TRAILING EMPTY ALTERNATIVE. macOS /usr/bin/grep (BSD 2.6.0-FreeBSD)
#                        exits 2 on that, so `grep -qE "$re" && return 0` never fired.
#                        Harmless ONLY BY ACCIDENT: copy_product returns earlier for paths
#                        absent from the new release, and the scaffold ships nothing under
#                        docs/benchmarks/ today. The day it does, the guard written to protect
#                        an adopter's file would have replaced it instead.
#                        Now: an `if` guarding the append (not `&&`, which is the shape that
#                        aborted setup.sh under set -e in v0.22.0); exclude_regex_sane() as a
#                        shared function; and a RUNTIME guard that dies naming the bad value,
#                        because assembling a regex and never checking it is the actual defect.
#                        5 selftest cases, both directions, mutation-verified.
#   2026-08-22 v0.19.0 — THE CLOSING INSTRUCTION COMMITTED THE SIDECAR IT HAD JUST WRITTEN
#                        (#239). This script ended by printing `git add -A && git commit`,
#                        which stages the unreconciled `.scaffold-<version>` copies left when
#                        a product file could not be overwritten -- and tools/conflict_scan.sh
#                        then fails the NEXT preflight on them, two gates away from the line
#                        that caused it. Reproduced 2026-08-21 upgrading Robiton/localcoder
#                        0.73.0 -> 0.74.0, which kept .github/CONTRIBUTING.md.
#                        With sidecars outstanding the closing text now withholds the
#                        one-liner, names each sidecar with its diff and `git rm`, and offers
#                        a `-- ':!*.scaffold-*'` pathspec for committing the rest first. With
#                        none, the message is unchanged.
#                        Four selftest cases, mutation-verified: widening the `kept` guard
#                        fails all four.
#   2026-08-12 v0.18.0 — THE BARE-RUN SELFTEST WAS UPGRADING THE HOST REPOSITORY. It ran
#                        `cd "$ROOT" && bash "$SELF"` with no arguments, on the reasoning
#                        that a bare run "will exit non-zero for want of a network or a base
#                        tag". TRUE HERE, FALSE IN AN ADOPTION: an adopter has a valid
#                        .scaffold-version, a network and gh, so it SUCCEEDED and performed a
#                        real upgrade — PRODUCT files replaced, sidecars written, exit 0.
#                        preflight.sh runs every selftest, so an adopter running the gate they
#                        are told to run before every push had their tree upgraded as a side
#                        effect of CHECKING it. Measured in Robiton/localcoder: preflight
#                        rewrote tools/preflight.sh mid-run. Now runs in a disposable empty
#                        git repo, which stops in the prologue by construction everywhere.
#   2026-08-11 v0.17.0 — THE FIXTURE NOW RUNS THE BARE INVOCATION. Asked for by the adopter
#                        who found the 3.2 bug, and correctly: the zero-argument run is the
#                        DEFAULT and the one the docs prescribe, while every other case
#                        here passes --from and --to so it can work offline. So the bug
#                        lived in the only path nothing exercised.
#                        The case asserts one thing — no unbound-variable abort — and
#                        tolerates any exit code, because a bare run legitimately fails for
#                        want of a network. It guards THE WHOLE PRE-HANDOVER PROLOGUE, not
#                        the single line that broke, because that region is effectively
#                        un-upgradable for an existing adopter: a fix to it can only arrive
#                        through the release they are already on, so it earns a different
#                        standard of care. Verified to fail by reinstating the defect.
#   2026-08-11 v0.16.0 — THE HANDOVER ABORTED ON macOS FOR A BARE RUN. RELEASE-BLOCKING.
#                        macOS ships bash 3.2.57, where an EMPTY array expanded as
#                        "${a[@]}" under `set -u` is treated as UNBOUND and aborts — fixed
#                        upstream in bash 4.4, which no Mac has. `_ORIG_ARGS=("$@")` is
#                        empty on a bare `tools/scaffold_upgrade.sh`, so line 1171 died
#                        before the handover could exec anything.
#                        THE ASYMMETRY IS THE DEFECT. `--dry-run` is one argument, so the
#                        array is non-empty and the dry run passes CLEANLY. The bare run —
#                        the only one that writes — is the only one that fails. Dry-run
#                        green, real run dead, on every macOS adopter.
#                        And the hand-over design cannot rescue it: this line IS the
#                        handover, so it aborts in the OUTGOING copy and the fixed copy
#                        never executes. A fix reaches an adopter only through the release
#                        they are already on, which is why this is a patch release.
#                        WHY THE FIXTURE COULD NOT FIND IT: every selftest case passes
#                        --from and --to so it can run offline against a synthetic
#                        upstream, so _ORIG_ARGS is never empty here. Found on a real M3
#                        adoption at 0.34.0. The new cases therefore have a different shape
#                        — they assert the EXPANSION under the real 3.2 binary and grep the
#                        source, rather than running an upgrade.
#                        The grep guard needed two false positives removed first: the naive
#                        pattern matched the explanatory COMMENTS and the guarded form
#                        itself, since `${a[@]+"${a[@]}"}` contains `"${a[@]}"` as a
#                        substring. A guard that flags its own fix is worse than none.
#   2026-08-11 v0.15.0 — DELIVERS .githooks/pre-push, AND REPAIRS ITS MODE ON ARRIVAL
#                        (#171). Shipping the file is the whole point: .git/hooks is not
#                        versioned and does not come with a clone, so a hook nobody can
#                        receive is a rule enforced on whoever happened to install it.
#                        Nothing here ACTIVATES it — that is `setup.sh --install-hooks`, by
#                        hand, per machine. An upgrade that silently started gating pushes
#                        would be the guard ai/SECURITY.md warns about.
#                        THE MODE REPAIR IS NOT BELT-AND-BRACES. `cp` carries the source
#                        mode, so a 755 upstream needs no help — but measured on this
#                        project's own machine, `core.fileMode` is false (OneDrive working
#                        copy) and `chmod +x` is therefore INVISIBLE to git: the hook was
#                        committed 100644 and took `git update-index --chmod=+x` to record.
#                        A maintainer on such a machine ships an inert hook to every
#                        adopter and gets no warning, because git ignores a non-executable
#                        hook SILENTLY. The selftest fixture ships 644 on purpose so the
#                        repair is load-bearing rather than decorative — verified to fail
#                        without it. `tools/localcoder` left the chmod arm; it went in W-15.
#   2026-08-11 v0.13.0 — DUAL_HOMED_GOVERNANCE: dual-homed and force-installed is a
#                        MECHANISM, not a leak (#D-19). localcoder_sync.py joined DUAL_HOMED
#                        and the "every DUAL_HOMED tools/ path is owned-excluded" assertion
#                        failed it, correctly by its own terms and wrongly on the merits.
#                        That assertion exists for PRODUCT files: #115, where vendoring a
#                        second copy of localcoder into the repo that ships it made the drift
#                        check silently move onto the vendored file. localcoder_sync.py is
#                        this governance layer, not product — localcoder runs it the way it
#                        runs preflight.sh — and force-installing it is exactly what has kept
#                        the two copies byte-identical with nobody syncing them by hand.
#                        Listed as an explicit exception rather than loosening the check, and
#                        verified by injection: a PRODUCT file added to DUAL_HOMED and
#                        forgotten here still fails, which is the api_digest.py case the
#                        assertion was written for.
#   2026-08-09 v0.12.1 — The verify step names the failing lines (#182). It discarded the
#                        output and said 'setup.sh --check reported problems — run it',
#                        which sent an adopter to the first [!] they saw: advisory, exit
#                        0, and not the cause. Saying something is wrong without saying
#                        what makes the reader pick a suspect.
#   2026-08-09 v0.12.0 — THE NEWER UPGRADER DOES THE WORK (#179). A fix to this tool could
#                        not fix the upgrade that installs it: the copy doing the work is
#                        the one VENDORED IN THE ADOPTER, i.e. the release being left. So
#                        every defect here was repaired one upgrade late, by the broken
#                        version. Measured, three times, on one project: .gitattributes
#                        became union-merged in 0.12.0 and an 0.11.3 -> 0.24.0 upgrade still
#                        deleted 24 Git LFS patterns, because 0.11.3's copy did the
#                        replacing. The fix was correct, shipped, and could not run.
#                        Before anything is written, if the target release carries a newer
#                        scaffold_upgrade.sh, the whole run is handed to it — the same code
#                        that is about to be installed either way.
#                        HONEST LIMIT: this cannot help an adopter whose vendored copy
#                        predates it. Reproduced in a fixture — 0.11.3 -> a release carrying
#                        the handover still lost 2 of 2 LFS patterns. Anyone on <=0.11.x
#                        must fetch this file before upgrading; setup.sh and the release
#                        notes say so.
#                        Arguments are saved before the parse loop shifts them, because a
#                        handover that silently drops --dry-run is the one failure with no
#                        undo. The injection that drops them fails 22 checks, not one.
#                        The conflict-marker case is anchored at column 0, matching what
#                        conflict_scan.sh actually treats as a conflict — the fixture now
#                        installs a real upgrader, which necessarily contains the string it
#                        greps for.
#   2026-08-09 v0.11.0 — OWNS_LOCALCODER_PATHS gains tools/api_digest.py, and a check that
#                        it and localcoder_sync.py's DUAL_HOMED stay in agreement. The file
#                        was added to DUAL_HOMED this morning and not here, so the next real
#                        upgrade of Robiton/localcoder vendored tools/api_digest.py into the
#                        repo that ships it as src/localcoder/api_digest.py. Nothing failed:
#                        the drift check still resolved the product copy first, so it was
#                        visible only in `git status`.
#                        THE CHECK ITSELF SHIPPED BROKEN TWICE and both were caught by
#                        injection, not by reading. Its sed required `("` before `tools/`
#                        where DUAL_HOMED has `, `, so it extracted nothing and passed. Then
#                        it looked beside $BASH_SOURCE — but this script copies itself to
#                        $TMPDIR and re-execs, so it searched /tmp, found nothing, and took
#                        an else branch that reported OK. A check aimed away from the risk
#                        reads as coverage; a skip is not a pass. Both branches now fail.
#   2026-08-08 v0.10.0 — `.scaffold-<version>` sidecars no longer accumulate. A divergence
#                        is usually permanent, so writing one per release grew without
#                        bound: measured in Robiton/localcoder, 21 committed sidecars —
#                        3 files across 7 releases — for three decisions each made once,
#                        and its divergence is deliberate and forever (its docs name the
#                        command it installs on PATH). Now: one per file, the newest, and
#                        none at all once the divergence is resolved. Safe to delete
#                        because a sidecar is OUR released bytes, never adopter work —
#                        `git show <tag>:<path>` reproduces any of them.
#   2026-08-08 v0.9.0 — Warn when core.fileMode=false will record a force-installed tool
#                        NON-EXECUTABLE. Measured on the 0.15.0 upgrade: both consumers
#                        recorded tools/conflict_scan.sh at 644 though it arrived 755,
#                        and every discovery loop filters on [ -x ] — its 15 cases would
#                        have been skipped in silence in both repos. Advice, not an
#                        action: this command deliberately leaves the index alone so
#                        `git checkout .` stays a complete undo, and --chmod needs a
#                        staged path. Extracted as a function so it has a selftest.
#   2026-08-08 v0.8.2 — Point the conflict summary at tools/conflict_scan.sh. The exit 1
#                        and the paragraph above it were the whole mechanism for thirteen
#                        releases, and a non-zero exit at merge time says nothing about
#                        the commit that follows: this repo's own dev context committed
#                        the markers 0.14.0 wrote into ai/STANDARDS.md and stayed green.
#   2026-08-08 v0.8.1 — The refusal's re-fetch command is `gh api`, not a curl to
#                        raw.githubusercontent (#136). The upstream repo is PRIVATE, so
#                        that URL 404s for everyone — and `curl -sS -o` writes the 404 body
#                        into the target, so the one command that rescues a stranded repo
#                        instead left a "script" whose first line was `404: Not Found`.
#                        The path is QUOTED because zsh globs `?`.
#   2026-08-08 v0.8.0 — A product-owned file is not automatically ours to replace (#125).
#                        .gitattributes was on PRODUCT_FILES and holds adopters' Git LFS
#                        patterns; every upgrade deleted them, exit 0, under a heading
#                        reading "no adopter content by construction". Twice in one repo,
#                        693 binaries into history as raw blobs the first time, and silent
#                        because LFS stops applying rather than erroring. It is union-merged
#                        now, keyed on the PATTERN not the whole line — last match wins in
#                        that file, so appending ours below an adopter's deliberate
#                        `-merge` would have overturned it.
#                        The classification was never the real instrument: "no adopter
#                        content" is a PREDICTION, and it was wrong twice from one cause —
#                        AGENTS.md was caught pre-release only because a checker pointed at
#                        it, .gitattributes went four months because none did. So every
#                        remaining product file is now compared against the copy it SHIPPED
#                        as ($BASE, already fetched for the three-way merges): identical
#                        means untouched and safe to replace, different means someone edited
#                        it and the incoming version goes to <file>.scaffold-<TO> instead.
#                        Found by that rule on this machine: Robiton/localcoder's
#                        scaffold-check.yml scans src/localcoder/* as well as tools/*,
#                        because scanning only tools/ left THE PRODUCT unchecked by its own
#                        CI — a fix that lived in a product-owned file and would have been
#                        reverted, silently, with CI still green.
#                        tools/ is EXEMPT and stays force-installed: the ceilings live in
#                        ai/STANDARDS.md precisely because tools/ is overwritten, and
#                        honouring edits there is how a project quietly forks its tooling.
#                        The fixture had NO product-owned files at all, which is why 23
#                        checks passed over this for four months — copy_product() returns
#                        early when the release does not ship the path. Three are shipped
#                        in it now; 4 of the 7 new checks fail against the old code and 3
#                        are controls that pass against both.
#                        Also (#130): the scaffold's-own-repo refusal now NAMES the version
#                        that refused and the re-fetch command. That message reads as
#                        "nothing to do", and an older copy of this file emitted the same
#                        sentence for any repo carrying mirror-sync.yml — Robiton/localcoder
#                        believed it and sat 13 releases behind. The fix for that check
#                        ships inside this file, so a stale copy cannot deliver its own
#                        replacement; the only exit is a human re-fetching it, and nobody
#                        re-fetches a tool that reports success.
#   2026-08-07 v0.7.1 — The banner catches BOLD rule lead-ins, not only headings, and never
#                        truncates a section heading. These files state most rules as **bold
#                        paragraphs**, so matching `^#` alone covered the rarer form and
#                        missed the common one — proven on the very next real upgrade, where
#                        0.11.0 -> 0.11.2 delivered the scaffold:owns-localcoder rule as a
#                        bold lead-in and printed no banner at all. Adding bold then took a
#                        real 0.5.0 -> 0.5.4 from 7 named rules to 18 and the old 14-line cap
#                        pushed "No secrets in prompts or agent memory" — the rule the banner
#                        exists for — into "and 4 more", so headings now print in full and
#                        only bold lead-ins are capped.
#   2026-08-06 v0.7.0 — Name the agent-visible rules an upgrade delivers, do not count them
#                        (#118). AGENTS.md and the four ai/ standards are merged into every
#                        adopter AND loaded into every agent session, so a merge here changes
#                        what their agents DO — and the only signal was a line count.
#                        Measured on the real 0.5.0 -> 0.5.4 transition: an adopter was told
#                        "ai/SECURITY.md clean (+79 upstream lines)" while the merge delivered
#                        "No secrets in prompts or agent memory", and the next thing to
#                        mention it was his own agent refusing a commit he had made for
#                        months. This class has no failing build to read, so the upgrade is
#                        the only place it can be surfaced at all.
#   2026-08-06 v0.6.0 — scaffold:owns-localcoder (#115). tools/ is force-installed, so the
#                        repo that SHIPS localcoder was about to receive a vendored copy of
#                        its own product — and localcoder_sync.py resolves tools/localcoder
#                        FIRST, so the drift check would have moved onto the duplicate and
#                        stopped watching src/localcoder/localcoder, passing throughout.
#                        audit_localcoder.sh resolves a tools/ path too. Eight files are
#                        suppressed under the marker, including .localcoder-sync, which
#                        records this repo own path and stamp. Announced on screen, because
#                        an invisible exclusion is indistinguishable from a bug. Three
#                        selftest cases including the without-marker direction, since an
#                        exclusion that over-fires silently stops vendoring for everyone.
#   2026-08-06 v0.5.0 — The scaffold-own-repo check needs ALL THREE signals, not just
#                        mirror-sync.yml (#113). That comment claimed the marker "exists
#                        only in the scaffold s own repo"; Robiton/localcoder mirrors too,
#                        so this REFUSED to upgrade it and stranded it five releases behind
#                        in silence — the message is confident and wrong, so it reads as
#                        "nothing to do". overlays/ alone is no better: setup.sh does not
#                        delete it, so a template clone keeps it and is a real adoption.
#                        Two selftest cases, both directions; 23 checks had never asked what
#                        "the scaffold s own repository" means.
#   (header said 0.4.0 while this entry read 0.4.1 — pre-existing, corrected forward 2026-08-06)
#   2026-08-05 v0.4.1 — Never carry eval data or a BASELINE into an adopter. A baseline is
#                        a regression gate keyed to one machine's models; inherited, it
#                        fails builds over a comparison nobody made.
#   2026-08-05 v0.4.0 — Surface a file-header shortfall as a MIGRATION with a named remedy,
#                        not as a red build after the upgrade. Reported from a real 0.5.0 ->
#                        0.6.3 upgrade (#76): the upgrade was flawless, then CI failed 33
#                        pre-existing files and the PR could not merge.
#   2026-08-05 v0.3.2 — Never carry benchmark DATA into an adopter. docs/ is refreshed, and
#                        "refresh" means "update files that already exist" — so an adopter
#                        who had run a benchmark would have had their own measurements
#                        overwritten by the maintainer's. The runbook still refreshes; only
#                        the data and the reference rows are excluded.
#   2026-08-05 v0.3.1 — `mktemp -t NAME` is BSD-only; GNU mktemp needs X's in the template.
#                        The tool had never run on Linux, and the failure was in the re-exec
#                        so nothing else could report it. Found by CI, which is the only
#                        Linux in the loop — not by any of my macOS runs.
#   2026-08-05 v0.3.0 — `--selftest`: 23 end-to-end checks against a synthetic upstream and
#                        a synthetic adoption, no network. Every defect in this tool so far
#                        was found by running it — four from a hand-built fixture, two from
#                        the first real project it touched — so the fixture is now scripted.
#                        Writing it found one more: a five-line AGENTS.md put the adopter's
#                        filled-in row on the LAST line, so any upstream append was adjacent
#                        and conflicted. The real file is ~90 lines with sections after the
#                        table. A fixture that is merely smaller than the real file is a

#   2026-08-05 v0.2.0 — Fall back to the newest release at or below the recorded version
#                        when .scaffold-version names something that was never tagged.
#                        Found on the FIRST real use: build stamps advance every PR while
#                        tags exist only at releases, so every project tracking main — the
#                        state scaffold_version.sh reports as fine — could not use this
#                        command at all, and the error advised `--from`, which cannot help
#                        because the ref exists nowhere.
#   2026-08-04 v0.1.0 — Initial creation
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#   Updating was a documented file-by-file copy, and the four standards files were on the
#   "do not overwrite" list because they hold adopter content — overlay appends, the
#   ceilings marker, local edits. So nobody could take upstream changes to them at all.
#
#   MEASURED 2026-08-04: 430 lines changed across ai/STANDARDS.md, ai/CODING.md,
#   ai/SECURITY.md and ai/PLANNING.md in the four weeks between v0.4.0 and v0.5.2. An
#   adopter following the documented procedure got NONE of it — no agent threat model, no
#   drafting brief, no "work that leaves no trace in git", and a review gate two revisions
#   stale. Their standards freeze on the day they adopt, permanently.
#
#   Demonstrated on this project's own dev repo, which is a normal scaffold adoption: it
#   was three sections behind and still carried the "≈75–85% accurate" framing that its own
#   MEMORY.md records as superseded. The dogfooding repo was running standards it had
#   written the correction for, because nothing ever told it to update.
#
# HOW THE HARD PART IS SOLVED
#   `.scaffold-version` names the release you adopted. That is the missing third input for
#   a real THREE-WAY MERGE, and it is what that file was created for:
#
#       base   = the file as it shipped in YOUR release
#       ours   = your file now (overlay appendix, ceilings, local edits)
#       theirs = the file in the new release
#
#   `git merge-file` then applies upstream changes to regions you never touched, keeps your
#   edits to regions upstream never touched, and marks the genuine collisions rather than
#   guessing. Overlay appendices and the ceilings line survive because you edited them and
#   upstream did not.
#
#   Without `.scaffold-version` there is no base, so a three-way merge is impossible and
#   this script REFUSES to merge rather than overwriting — see the check below.
#
# SAFETY, in the terms ai/SECURITY.md already states
#   The hard line is "never mutate state without a snapshot you have verified is
#   restorable". Here the snapshot is git: this refuses to run on a dirty tree, so
#   `git checkout .` is a verified undo for everything it does. It never writes
#   SESSION/BACKLOG/MEMORY/TEAM/version/CODEOWNERS or any *_ARCHIVE.md — the files that
#   hold what you cannot regenerate.
#
# Usage:
#   tools/scaffold_upgrade.sh --dry-run          # show the plan, change nothing
#   tools/scaffold_upgrade.sh                    # upgrade to the latest release

# RE-EXEC FROM A COPY BEFORE TOUCHING ANYTHING.
#
# This script lives in tools/, and the upgrade REPLACES tools/. Bash reads a script
# incrementally as it executes, so overwriting the file mid-run makes it resume at a byte
# offset into different content — a silent, near-undebuggable failure that only fires on
# the runs that matter. Copy to a temp location and hand over before any write happens.

  # "too few X's" — so this tool never ran on Linux at all, and because the failure is in
  # the re-exec it happened before anything else could report it. Every test run of mine

  # ---- 2c. THE HANDOVER MUST SURVIVE AN EMPTY ARGUMENT LIST (bash 3.2) ---------------
  #
  # macOS ships bash 3.2.57, where an EMPTY array expanded as "${a[@]}" under `set -u` is
  # treated as unbound and ABORTS. Fixed upstream in bash 4.4; irrelevant to an adopter on
  # a Mac. Reproduced on 3.2.57: `a=(); echo "${a[@]}"` exits 127.
  #
  # EVERY CASE ABOVE PASSES --from AND --to, because they must run offline against a
  # synthetic upstream. So _ORIG_ARGS is never empty in this fixture and a full-upgrade
  # test CANNOT reach this path — the bare run is the only one that fails, and the bare run
  # is the only one that writes. Dry-run green, real run dead.
  #
  # Found on a real M3 adoption, not here. The assertion therefore has a different shape
  # from every other case in this file: it tests the EXPANSION under the real 3.2 binary,
  # and greps the source so the unguarded form cannot come back anywhere.
  # THE ZERO-ARGUMENT INVOCATION, END TO END, UNDER THE REAL 3.2 BINARY.
  #
  # Asked for by the adopter who found the original bug: the bare run is the DEFAULT
  # invocation and the one the docs tell people to use, and every other case in this file
  # passes --from and --to so it can work offline. So this runs the real script with NO
  # arguments and asserts only that it gets past the prologue — it will exit non-zero for
  # want of a network or a base tag, which is fine and expected. What must NEVER appear is
  # an unbound-variable abort, because that is a syntax-level death before any work starts.
  #
  # THE WHOLE PRE-HANDOVER PROLOGUE IS EFFECTIVELY UN-UPGRADABLE for an existing adopter —
  # a fix to it can only arrive through the release they are already on — so it deserves a
  # different standard of care than the rest of the file. This case guards all of it, not
  # just the one line that broke.
  # IN A DISPOSABLE TREE, NEVER IN $ROOT — and getting that wrong made this the most
  # damaging defect the project has shipped.
  #
  # This case used to run `cd "$ROOT" && /bin/bash "$SELF"`, on the reasoning quoted above:
  # a bare run "will exit non-zero for want of a network or a base tag, which is fine and
  # expected". THAT IS TRUE HERE AND FALSE IN AN ADOPTION. Upstream there is no base tag to
  # resolve, so it bails. An adopter has a valid `.scaffold-version`, a network and `gh` —
  # so the bare run SUCCEEDS and performs a real upgrade of their repository.
  #
  # `tools/preflight.sh` discovers and runs every selftest. So an adopter running the gate
  # they are told to run before every push had their tree silently upgraded to the latest
  # release as a side effect of CHECKING it: PRODUCT files replaced, `.scaffold-<version>`
  # sidecars written, and exit 0 throughout. A check that mutates the thing it checks.
  #
  # Measured in Robiton/localcoder on 2026-08-12: `tools/preflight.sh` rewrote
  # tools/preflight.sh itself to a newer release mid-run and left a CONTRIBUTING.md sidecar.
  # It reproduces in every adoption and in none of our own repositories, which is why nothing
  # caught it — including tools/adoption_check.sh, whose fixture is a throwaway copy where a
  # mutation is invisible. That check now asserts the tree is unchanged afterwards.
  #
  # The case only ever needed the PROLOGUE to execute, so a bare empty git repo is a
  # strictly better subject: no `.scaffold-version`, so it stops early by construction,
  # everywhere, for the same reason on every machine.
  #
  # AND IT IS WEAKER THAN ITS NAME SUGGESTS, WHICH WAS ALSO TRUE BEFORE. Checked by
  # reintroducing the 2026-08-11 defect: this case still reports `ok`, because the abort was
  # at the HANDOVER and a run that stops in the prologue never reaches it. That was equally
  # true of the old `cd "$ROOT"` version — upstream it bailed for want of a base tag, so it
  # never reached the handover either. **The grep guard below is what actually catches that
  # defect**, and it does: it fails on the reintroduced version. This case is a smoke test
  # that the prologue parses and runs, which is worth having and is all it is.

  #
  # They asserted the owns-localcoder exclusion in both directions: with the marker, no
  # vendored tools/localcoder arrives and the repo keeps its own .localcoder-sync; without
  # it, the vendored copy MUST still arrive or every adopter silently stops receiving
  # localcoder. All three were correct and all three now have no subject — the scaffold
  # ships no localcoder to vendor or to withhold.
  #
  # None of them was wrong. The change they were pointed at removed the property they
  # described, which is the third time this week a test has been retired rather than fixed
  # (check-not-requested-ok, and the DUAL_HOMED agreement assertion above). Retiring with a
  # note beats deleting, and beats leaving them passing vacuously against a fixture that
  # manufactures the file they look for.

  # implementation AT ALL, asserted unconditionally, with no marker and no exemption list.

#          patterns in it (#125). The class is now handled two ways rather than by
#          predicting which files adopters edit: `.gitattributes` moved to UNION below,
#          and every remaining PRODUCT file is checked against the copy it SHIPPED as

# `.claude/` AND `.agents/` WERE FROZEN AT WHATEVER VERSION THE ADOPTER COPIED (#291).
# scaffold_upgrade.sh did not touch either directory at all, so every hook fix this project
# has shipped — the PreCompact hook, the `--wire` fix, the un-silencing of the session hook,
# all of the 0.88.x work — reached exactly zero adopters through an upgrade. Nothing said
# so, because nothing compared what an adoption RECEIVES against what an upgrade REFRESHES;
# tools/adoption_manifest.sh --check now does, and this line is what it found.
#
# `.claude/settings.json` IS DELIBERATELY NOT HERE. That file is the adopter's own Claude
# Code configuration and may hold permissions, MCP servers and hooks we know nothing about.
# `settings.hooks.json` is the CANONICAL scaffold set and is ours; delivering it makes
# `setup.sh --check` say "missing hooks (…) — re-run ./setup.sh", which is a report the
# adopter acts on rather than an edit made to their config behind their back.
# The `.example.json` guard ships alongside it and stays inert by its name, as designed.
# `.githooks/pre-push` SHIPS BUT IS NOT ACTIVATED. Delivering the file is the whole point of
# #171 — `.git/hooks` is not versioned and does not come with a clone, so a hook nobody can
# receive is a rule enforced on whoever happened to install it. But nothing here runs
# `git config core.hooksPath`: that is `setup.sh --install-hooks`, by hand, per machine.
# An upgrade that silently started gating pushes would be the guard ai/SECURITY.md warns
# about — one that blocks legitimate work, gets ripped out, and then protects nothing.
# `overlays/` is deliberately NOT here. setup.sh appends the chosen overlay's content into
# ai/STANDARDS.md and ai/CODING.md at init; the overlays directory itself is not something
# an adoption carries, and installing it on upgrade would add a tree nobody asked for.
# INSTALL: added even if the project never had them — the CI workflow CALLS tools/, so
#   shipping a newer workflow without them is how you get a warning instead of a check.
# REFRESH: only files that already exist are updated. An upgrade should not push a docs/
#   tree into a project that deliberately never took one.

    #      tools/secret_scan.sh to stop exactly that.
    #   2. The two variables it exists to pass were silently dropped, and
    #      SCAFFOLD_UPGRADE_REEXEC was never unset -- so the handover ran without the
    #      environment the re-exec logic depends on, and nothing said so.

    # The comments now sit ABOVE the command and the continuation is contiguous.

    # ${a[@]+"${a[@]}"} -- NOT "${_ORIG_ARGS[@]}". macOS ships bash 3.2.57, where an EMPTY
    # array expanded as "${a[@]}" under `set -u` is treated as UNBOUND and aborts the script
    # (bash fixed this in 4.4). Reproduced on 3.2.57: `a=(); echo "${a[@]}"` exits 127 with
    # "a[@]: unbound variable".
    #
    # THE ASYMMETRY IS THE WHOLE DEFECT AND IT IS THE NASTIEST POSSIBLE SHAPE. `--dry-run`

# DISK, and a tool that lands non-executable is a tool that silently stops running.
#
# This is not hypothetical and it is not rare. Measured 2026-08-08: the 0.15.0 upgrade
# force-installed `tools/conflict_scan.sh` at 755 on disk into BOTH consumers, and both
# recorded it 644 — because both had just set `core.fileMode false` (correctly: their
# filesystem reports 0700 for every file). CI discovery filters on `[ -x ]`, so the tool's
# 15 cases would have been skipped in silence in both repos, in the same session that made
# a skipped suite a hard failure precisely because it looks identical to a passing one.
#
# WHY THIS IS ADVICE AND NOT AN ACTION. The upgrade deliberately does not touch the index —
# it leaves a reviewable working tree so `git checkout .` is a complete undo, which is the
# snapshot argument in ai/SECURITY.md. `git update-index --chmod` needs the path to be in
# the index, which it is not until the adopter stages. So the honest move is to name the
# exact command at the moment it is needed, and to say what it costs to skip it.
#
# The backstop is elsewhere and it is real: CI fails when a tools/ file advertises
# `--selftest` and is not executable. This message is what stops that from being a surprise.
