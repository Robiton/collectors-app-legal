# Modified: 2026-08-09
# Version:  0.5.0.20260809.1045
# Purpose:  PreToolUse guard — turn the ai/SECURITY.md hard lines into actual rules.
# Changelog:
#   2026-08-09 v0.5.0 — Non-allow decisions are appended to the run log. A security
#                        decision that leaves no record is one nobody can review: the
#                        guard prompts, the human answers, and the exchange vanishes
#                        with the terminal — so "has this ever fired", "what did it stop"
#                        and "is it even wired" all had no answer, and the last of those
#                        was NO for months on this project's own machine.
#                        Allows are NOT logged: this runs on every matching tool call, so
#                        logging them would write thousands of lines a day and bury the
#                        few entries anyone would want. The guard fails open and its
#                        logging fails quiet — instrumentation must never be why a call
#                        is blocked.
#   2026-08-06 v0.2.1 — The selftest's branch probe is a def, not an assigned lambda (#98).
#                        Behaviour identical: `_b=branch` still captures this iteration's
#                        value. Pure lint compliance — E731.
#   2026-08-04 v0.2.0 — Close three gaps found by self-audit, all of which the original
#                        17/17 suite passed over. `rm -r -f`, `rm -f -r`,
#                        `rm --recursive --force` and `rm build/ -rf` were allowed
#                        silently: the matcher recognised exactly the two spellings its
#                        own tests used. Flags are now parsed rather than pattern-matched.
#                        `git commit` on main was invisible — the guard checked EDITS on
#                        main, a proxy for the rule, never the commit itself. And a shell
#                        write to a protected path (`echo >> ai/SECURITY.md`,
#                        `sed -i tools/guard_pretooluse.py`) bypassed the protected-path
#                        check entirely, because that check looked only at Edit/Write.
#   2026-08-04 v0.1.0 — Initial creation
"""guard_pretooluse — a PreToolUse hook that enforces the hard lines, rather than asking.

WHY THIS EXISTS
  ai/PLANNING.md says it plainly: a rule written only in an ai/ file or AGENTS.md is a
  REQUEST — the model can drift past it. For truly critical guardrails, a hook is an
  actual rule. This is that hook for the three hard lines the scaffold states:

    1. Never mutate production data without a verified-restorable snapshot
       (ai/SECURITY.md). Measured in one adoption: backup-db.sh had been failing
       silently for ~4 months, committed without its executable bit.
    2. Never commit directly to main (ai/CODING.md -> Version control). Both the commit
       and an edit made while on main are checked — the commit is the rule, the edit is
       an early warning, and for a while only the early warning existed.
    3. Protected paths — the files that define the guardrails must not be edited by
       the same agent the guardrails constrain, without a human in the loop. Checked for
       Edit/Write AND for shell writes, because `echo >> ai/SECURITY.md` is the same act.

DESIGN: CONTAINMENT OVER PREVENTION
  This hook cannot detect a clever attack and does not try. Pattern-matching a command
  string is defeated by `e''cho`, base64, a shell variable, or a script that does the
  work one level down. What it CAN do is make the dangerous-by-accident case loud and
  the dangerous-on-purpose case require a deliberate step. Treat it as a seatbelt, not
  a firewall — and read ai/SECURITY.md -> Agent threat model for why that distinction
  is the whole design.

  Consequence: it prefers "ask" to "deny" almost everywhere. A guard that blocks
  legitimate work gets disabled, and a disabled guard protects nothing — the same
  failure mode as a warning that always fires.

CONTRACT (https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks.md)

  exit 0 : decision honoured from stdout JSON
  A hook that crashes must NOT block the session, so every failure path falls through
  to allow. A guard that breaks your tooling is a guard you remove.

Usage (wired in .claude/settings.json — shipped commented out, see that file):
