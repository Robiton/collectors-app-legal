# Modified: 2026-09-03
# Version:  0.9.2.20260903.1906
# Purpose:  Every `scaffold:` marker at column 0 is one this scaffold actually reads.
# Changelog:
#   2026-09-03 v0.9.2.20260903.1906 — register scaffold:ai-file-kind, read by tools/preflight.sh (#293).
#   2026-09-01 v0.9.1.20260901.1656 — REGISTERS hooks-unavailable (#275). The escape hatch
#                        for a client with no lifecycle hooks was read by session_hook.sh and
#                        absent from this registry, so --audit reported that nothing reads
#                        it. An unregistered marker is one a future cleanup deletes as dead.
#   2026-08-26 v0.9.0 — register scaffold:provenance, read by tools/provenance_check.sh. The registry key is
#                        the name before the SECOND colon -- `closeouts` covers
#                        `closeouts:begin` -- so this is one row, not two.
#   2026-08-19 v0.8.0 — `session-log` registered. tools/session_currency.sh reads it to find
#                        a record that lives in a sibling repo, which is where the split put
#                        localcoder's and the scaffold's own.
#   2026-08-18 — the three status_block markers registered. A marker nothing reads is
#                        indistinguishable from one that works, and this gate caught all three
#                        the moment they landed — which is the gate doing exactly its job on
#                        the author who added it.
#   2026-08-17 v0.6.0.20260817.0957 — register `closeouts`. THE SCAFFOLD SHIPPED A TOOL THAT WRITES AN
#                        UNREGISTERED MARKER. tools/close_out.py has written
#                        `scaffold:closeouts:begin/end` into ai/SESSION.md since 0.43.0, and
#                        this registry never listed it -- so every adopter who used the
#                        closeout adapter, which the session checklist tells them to use,
#                        failed setup.sh --check on a marker the scaffold itself put there.
#                        Found by an adopter's tree failing after an unrelated upgrade, which
#                        is the worst way to find it: the gate fires on work they did not do,
#                        in a file they did not edit, naming a marker they never typed.
#                        The reader column is close_out.py, so the reverse check -- a
#                        registered marker with nobody reading it -- is satisfied too.
#   2026-08-15 v0.5.0.20260815.1925 — Registers `version-stamp-baseline`, read by
#                        tools/release_status.sh. The gate caught its own author: the
#                        baseline was declared in AGENTS.md and wired to a real reader in the
#                        same change, and this registry still refused it — correctly, because
#                        "declared and wired" and "declared and inert" are indistinguishable
#                        from the declaration alone. That is the whole argument for the
#                        registry, demonstrated on the person adding a marker.
#   2026-08-16 v0.4.0.20260816.0900 — Registers `ci-down-until`, read by tools/ci_status.sh. Added
#                        because this gate CAUGHT IT: the declaration went into three AGENTS.md
#                        files and setup.sh --check went red on the same run, naming the file,
#                        the line and the reason. That is the composition rule working on a
#                        marker introduced an hour earlier, by the author who wrote the rule.
#   2026-08-15 v0.3.0.20260815.1100 — #212: SEGFAULT ON AN ADOPTER'S REPOSITORY, FIXED BY NOT WALKING EVERY
#                        TRACKED FILE. rc=139, empty output, 100% deterministic, taking
#                        setup.sh --check and preflight red on a repo where nothing was wrong.
#                        The loop iterated `git ls-files` — 3,903 files there — and opened a
#                        NESTED process substitution inside each iteration while the outer one
#                        stayed open. macOS ships bash 3.2.57, which backs process substitution
#                        with /dev/fd; thousands nested is the shape that faults. The reporter's
#                        bisect is what made it legible: same bash either way, dying only
#                        through the shebang from a bash parent, and SIGSEGV becoming SIGBUS
#                        under `env -i`.
#                        THEY ALSO NAMED THE FIX WITHOUT KNOWING IT: secret_scan.sh and
#                        stale_path_scan.sh walk the same tree and are fine because they
#                        PREFILTER with one `git grep`. This now does the same, so the loop
#                        visits the handful of files that contain a marker.
#                        -I SKIPS BINARIES. A marker can only appear in a text file, so feeding
#                        ~700 .gltf/.bin/PNG/LFS blobs to grep was wasted work independent of
#                        the crash — and a marker-shaped byte run inside an asset is not a
#                        declaration.
#                        Reproduced locally by mutation: restoring the per-file walk kills an
#                        800-file fixture with 200 binaries.
#   2026-08-14 v0.2.0 — --audit NO LONGER ACCEPTS A COMMENT AS EVIDENCE OF A READER, and
#                        found FOUR wrong rows out of twelve the moment it stopped.
#                        `not-a-secret` was credited to conflict_scan.sh on the strength of a
#                        comment reading "the same argument as scaffold:not-a-secret in
#                        tools/secret_scan.sh applies"; `ceilings` to conflict_scan.sh, which
#                        only builds one inside a printf fixture; `no-artifact` to
#                        header_check.sh, when setup.sh reads it. All three passed.
#                        `localcoder-forked` is RETIRED: nothing in any repository reads it
#                        outside a comment. It gated a drift check on a vendored
#                        tools/localcoder and the scaffold stopped shipping one in W-15 —
#                        the second dead marker of this exact shape after `-diverged`.
#                        A READ IS CODE. The signal is a mention on a line whose first
#                        non-blank character is not `#`. RESIDUAL WEAKNESS, STATED: a marker
#                        inside a fixture STRING on a code line still reads as a reader, which
#                        is why a row is checked for MEMBERSHIP in the derived set and why an
#                        empty derived set is a hard failure.
#   2026-08-13 v0.1.0 — New. THE COMPOSITION RULE, MADE MECHANICAL.
#                        A marker is a declaration read by a downstream consumer, and a
#                        declaration nothing reads is indistinguishable from one that works.
#                        There are thirteen marker names in this tree, all read at column 0,
#                        every one by a different grep in a different tool, and a misspelling
#                        is SILENTLY INERT — `scaffold:must-runs` looks exactly like a
#                        declaration and does exactly nothing. That is defect 1 of this
#                        programme in its purest form, and it had no checker.
#
#                        Found on its first run, live in `ai/STANDARDS.md` — the file loaded
#                        into every session — in ALL THREE repositories:
#
#                          <!-- scaffold:localcoder-diverged localcoder_bench.py -->
#                          <!-- scaffold:localcoder-diverged audit_localcoder.sh -->
#
#                        That marker was RETIRED with tools/localcoder_sync.py in W-15. The
#                        only mention left in tools/ is a sentence in README.md saying it is
#                        gone. Four declarations, three repositories, zero readers, sitting in
#                        the most-loaded file in the project and reading as live policy.

# ============================ THE REGISTRY ====================================
#
# Every marker this scaffold reads, and WHERE IT IS READ. The second column is not
# decoration: it is what makes an entry falsifiable. A registry that only lists names can go
# stale in the same way the markers did — a name stays in the list after its reader leaves,
# which is precisely how `localcoder-diverged` survived its own retirement.
#
# TO RETIRE A MARKER: delete the row, then run this. Every declaration of it in the tree now
# fails, which is the point — retiring a marker should be noisy on exactly the files that
# still declare it, not silent everywhere.
#
# TO ADD ONE: add the row, and make sure something reads it. `--audit` re-derives the reader
# column from the tree and complains if a registered marker has no reader, so a marker
# invented and never wired up is caught by the same gate.

# ============================ THE SCAN =========================================
#
# COLUMN 0 ONLY, because that is the convention every reader already follows and AGENTS.md
# states: "an indented example is documentation, not a declaration". Scanning further left
# would make every worked example in the docs a declaration, and this checker would then
# fire on the files that teach people the syntax.
#
# Two forms, matching how the readers actually grep:
#   <!-- scaffold:<name> ... -->     markdown, the common case
#   # scaffold:<name> ...            shell and python
#
# A CHANGELOG LINE IS NOT A DECLARATION. `#   2026-08-05 v0.6.2 — the no-artifact marker`
# starts with `#` at column 0 and mentions a marker, and it is prose. The `#[[:space:]]*`
# anchor requires the marker to be the FIRST thing after the comment character, which is the
# same distinction stale_path_scan.sh draws between an instruction and a mention.
# ONE PROCESS FOR THE TREE, NOT TWO PER TRACKED FILE. THIS IS A CRASH FIX, NOT A TIDY-UP.
#
# Reported as #212 by an adopter on 0.39.0: `marker_scan.sh` SEGFAULTED, deterministically,
# with rc=139 and EMPTY output — taking `setup.sh --check` and therefore preflight red on a
# repository where nothing was wrong. Their bisect is what makes the cause legible: the same
# bash either way, dying only when launched through the `#!/usr/bin/env bash` shebang from a
# bash parent, and `env -i` turning SIGSEGV into SIGBUS. Both are memory faults.
#
# The loop iterated `git ls-files` — 3,903 files in their repo — and opened a NESTED PROCESS
# SUBSTITUTION inside each iteration, while the outer one stayed open. macOS ships bash 3.2.57,
# which implements process substitution with /dev/fd entries; thousands of them, nested, is the
# shape that faults. `secret_scan.sh` and `stale_path_scan.sh` walk the same tree and are fine
# BECAUSE THEY PREFILTER WITH ONE `git grep` — the adopter noticed exactly that difference and
# said so, which is what turned this from a crash report into a diagnosis.
#
# So the candidate list is now the handful of files that CONTAIN a marker, not every tracked
# file. -I skips binaries: a marker declaration can only appear in a text file, and feeding
# ~700 `.gltf`, `.bin`, PNG and LFS blobs to grep was wasted work independent of the crash.

# ============================ THE AUDIT ========================================
#
# The registry's second column claims a reader. This checks the claim, and it is the half
# that keeps the registry itself from becoming the next stale declaration — a name whose
# reader has left is exactly what `localcoder-diverged` was.
# WHICH FILES ACTUALLY READ A MARKER — DERIVED, NEVER DECLARED.
#
# "Mentions it" was the old test and it was far too weak. Measured 2026-08-14: FOUR of the
# twelve rows named the wrong file and all twelve passed, because a comment saying
# `the same argument as scaffold:not-a-secret in tools/secret_scan.sh applies` satisfies a
# grep for the marker. The instrument built to stop the registry becoming the next stale
# declaration had become one.
#
# The discriminating signal is that a READ is code. `ADJUDICATED='scaffold:not-a-secret|…'`
# and `re.compile(r"scaffold:ceilings…")` are executable; a `#` line explaining the marker is
# not. So: lines mentioning the marker whose first non-blank character is not `#`.
#
# RESIDUAL WEAKNESS, STATED RATHER THAN PAPERED OVER: a marker appearing inside a FIXTURE
# string on a code line reads as a reader. `conflict_scan.sh` builds a `scaffold:ceilings`
# marker inside a printf to make a merge-conflict fixture, and this cannot tell that from a
# read. That is why a row is checked for membership in the derived set rather than equality
# with it, and why a marker with an EMPTY derived set is a hard failure — the dead-marker
# case is the one that has actually bitten, twice.

  # ---- #212: A BIG TREE WITH BINARIES, FROM A BASH PARENT ------------------------------
  #
  # THE FIXTURE IS THE ADOPTER'S SHAPE, because that is the shape that found it: a repository
  # whose tracked tree is mostly assets. 800 files with 200 binary blobs, run through
  # `/bin/bash -c` — the launch path that segfaulted, since `bash <script>` directly exited 0
  # and only the `#!/usr/bin/env bash` shebang from a bash parent died.
  #
  # ASSERTS THE EXIT CODE AND THE OUTPUT, not just the exit code. A crash produces rc=139 AND
  # an empty body; a run that scans nothing produces rc=0 and a count of 0. Checking only the
  # code would pass a scanner that had silently stopped finding anything.
