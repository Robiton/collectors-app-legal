# Modified: 2026-08-14
# Version:  0.3.0.20260814.2100
# Purpose:  Fail the build when an unfinished upgrade is committed — conflict markers, or the
#           `.scaffold-<version>` sidecars a divergent PRODUCT file leaves behind.
# Changelog:
#   2026-08-14 v0.3.0.20260814.2100 — `scaffold:not-a-conflict` reports its count, at every value including
#                        zero. A run that suppressed six regions and a run with nothing to
#                        suppress printed the identical verdict.
#                        THE FIRST VERSION OF THIS COUNTER REPORTED 0 FOREVER. It passed the
#                        log path to awk through `-v`, and macOS's one-true-awk coerces a
#                        value beginning with `/` to the NUMBER -inf — so the redirect wrote
#                        nowhere, on the platform this project develops on. ENVIRON[] instead.
#                        Caught only because a selftest asserted a NUMBER; a case asserting
#                        that the line exists would have passed throughout.
#   2026-08-12 v0.2.1 — The sidecar check now requires TRACKED **and still on disk**.
#                        `git ls-files` reads the INDEX, so a sidecar just deleted and not
#                        yet staged still listed, and the tool failed the person in the
#                        middle of doing exactly what it asked for. Hit for real while
#                        reconciling localcoder's three: reconcile, rm, re-run, still red,
#                        with no hint that staging was the missing step. A guard that fires
#                        on its own remedy is one people route around.
#   2026-08-12 v0.2.0 — THE SIDECAR HALF, which had been invisible since 0.10.0 shipped it.
#                        An upgrade that cannot overwrite an edited PRODUCT file keeps the
#                        local one and drops the incoming version at `<file>.scaffold-<TO>`,
#                        printing an instruction to reconcile them. That instruction was the
#                        entire mechanism — the identical mistake this file was written to
#                        fix for conflict markers, one file class later.
#                        FOUND IN THE SIBLING localcoder REPO: three sidecars from the 0.29.4
#                        upgrade, tracked since 2026-08-09. One was scaffold-check.yml, and
#                        the cost was real — localcoder's copy carries a deliberate local edit
#                        and the scaffold's had since grown a check that catches silently
#                        retired test suites. Neither side was wrong; the merge was simply
#                        never finished, and nothing could say so.
#                        TRACKED IS THE SIGNAL. A sidecar the upgrade just wrote is untracked
#                        and correct; failing on it would fail the run that produced it.
#   2026-08-08 v0.1.0 — New. `scaffold_upgrade.sh` performs three-way merges on MERGE-class
#                        files and, when a hunk conflicts, writes ordinary git conflict
#                        markers into the adopter's file and TELLS THEM TO RESOLVE IT. That
#                        instruction was the entire mechanism: nothing ever checked that it
#                        happened.
#                        Measured, in this project's own dev repo: the 0.14.0 upgrade left
#                        `<<<<<<< yours` / `>>>>>>> scaffold 0.14.0` in ai/STANDARDS.md, the
#                        file every agent reads FIRST at session start. It was committed, it
#                        survived the 0.14.1 upgrade layered on top of it, and it passed
#                        every CI run in between. The one place the string was checked was
#                        scaffold_upgrade.sh's OWN selftest, asserting that the clean path
#                        writes no markers — a check aimed at the case that was never the
#                        risk, which this repo has now shipped four times.
#                        This is the class ai/MEMORY.md names: a rule with no checker behind
#                        it is not a rule. The upgrade tool's printed instruction was that
#                        rule; this file is the checker.

# A HUMAN ALREADY RULED ON THIS REGION. Documentation that DEMONSTRATES a conflict — a
# tutorial, a changelog quoting what an upgrade wrote — contains real markers at column 0 on
# purpose. The same argument as `scaffold:not-a-secret` in tools/secret_scan.sh applies: a
# prohibition with no sanctioned path gets worked around, and the workarounds available here
# are all worse (excluding docs/ wholesale is a hole; indenting the example corrupts it).
#
# LINE-SCOPED BY CONSTRUCTION, and accepted on ANY of the three marker lines so the example
# can carry it wherever it is least disruptive — usually the closer. It clears exactly the
# one region it sits in, never the file.
MARK='scaffold:not-a-conflict'

# THE PREFILTER IS ONE PROCESS FOR THE WHOLE TREE, AND THAT IS A SCALE PROPERTY.
# The obvious shape — walk `git ls-files -z` and grep each file — costs two processes per
# tracked file. Measured on a synthetic 5,000-file repo, that shape takes ~20s; the CI job
# it would run in budgets 5 minutes for everything. A 50k-file monorepo would spend the
# whole budget deciding it had nothing to report. `git grep` searches the tracked working
# tree in a single process, so the walk below only ever visits the handful of files that
# already look suspicious — and in the normal case, none.
#
# THE PREFILTER IS DELIBERATELY BROADER THAN THE VERDICT, and that direction is the safety
# argument. It matches any line STARTING with a marker run; the verdict below then decides
# whether those lines form a real region. A prefilter that is a strict superset can only
# ever cost time, never a detection. Narrowing it to "look like a real conflict" would put
# the real decision in two places, and the file whose regex drifts silently reports success
# for work it did not do.
PREFILTER='^(<<<<<<<|=======|>>>>>>>|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|)'

# -I skips binary files: a .png whose bytes happen to start a line with '=======' is not a
# conflict, and printing its contents as a finding is how a checker gets switched off.
candidates() {
  git grep -I -l -z -E "$PREFILTER" -- . 2>/dev/null || true

# Prints the unadjudicated conflict regions in $1. Empty output = file is clean.
#
# A REGION IS AN OPENER AND ITS CLOSER, NOT A LONE '======='. Markdown's setext heading
# underlines a title with '=' at column 0, so a rule that fired on the separator alone would
# fail on ordinary prose — including this repo's own docs. Requiring the pair means the
# check cannot be provoked by anything a human writes by hand.
#
# AN UNTERMINATED OPENER STILL COUNTS. A half-resolved conflict — someone deleted the
# '>>>>>>>' line and stopped — leaves the file broken in exactly the way this exists to
# catch, and '<<<<<<<' at column 0 does not otherwise occur in text.
# THE SUPPRESSION REPORTS ITS COUNT (design review 2026-08-14). `scaffold:not-a-conflict` is a
# human declaration that turns this check off for one region, and until now a run that
# suppressed six regions and a run with nothing to suppress printed the identical verdict.
# Zero is the interesting value in both directions: `0 adjudicated` on a clean tree means the
# tree is clean, and a nonzero count on a clean tree means somebody is standing on the check.
#
# THE COUNT GOES TO A FILE. conflict_regions is called inside `$( )`, a subshell, so a global
# counter would report 0 forever while looking correct — the same trap secret_scan.sh's
# counting hit, and the reason both are written this way.

# THE OTHER HALF OF AN UNFINISHED UPGRADE, and it has been invisible the whole time.
#
# When scaffold_upgrade.sh cannot reconcile a file it does one of two things. On a MERGE-class
# file it writes conflict markers — caught above, which is why this tool exists. On a PRODUCT
# file the adopter has edited it does something quieter: it KEEPS the local file and drops the
# incoming one alongside as `<file>.scaffold-<TO>`, printing an instruction to reconcile them.
# That instruction is the entire mechanism, exactly as the marker instruction was, and nothing
# checked that it happened either. Same defect, one file type later.
#
# TRACKED IS THE SIGNAL, NOT PRESENT. A sidecar that an upgrade just wrote is untracked and
# completely correct — it is the reconciliation waiting to be done. Once it is COMMITTED the
# reconciliation stopped, and a committed sidecar is invisible: it is not in any diff anyone
# reads again, it breaks no build, and it looks like an ordinary file in `ls`.
#
# MEASURED, in the sibling `localcoder` repo, on 2026-08-12: three sidecars from the 0.29.4
# upgrade tracked since 2026-08-09 — .github/CONTRIBUTING.md, docs/benchmarks/README.md and
# .github/workflows/scaffold-check.yml. The workflow one mattered. localcoder's copy carries a
# deliberate local edit (its selftest loop scans src/localcoder/, which IS the product) and the
# scaffold's copy had since grown an executable-bit check that catches silently-retired test
# suites. Neither side was wrong; the merge was simply never finished, so localcoder ran three
# days without a check it had already paid for, with the answer sitting in the repo the whole
# time under a filename nobody greps.
#
# `.scaffold-version` IS NOT ONE OF THESE. It is the base stamp the three-way merge needs, and
# it must stay tracked. The suffix below requires a full MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.YYYYMMDD.HHMM, which
# it does not have — excluded by shape rather than by a name in a list that would drift.

  # and that is not hypothetical: the first version of this counter passed its path to awk
  # through `-v`, which macOS's awk coerced to -inf, so the redirect wrote nowhere and every
  # run reported 0. It was caught by the equivalent case in stale_path_scan.sh asserting a 1.
