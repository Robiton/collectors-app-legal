# Modified: 2026-09-08
# Version:  0.5.1.20260908.1937
# Purpose:  Fail the build when the tree TELLS SOMEONE TO RUN a tools/ path that is not there,
#           or LINKS a reader to a file that is not there.
# Changelog:
#   2026-09-08 v0.5.1.20260908.1937 — an INLINE CODE SPAN is not a link, the same argument the
#                        fence rule already makes: GitHub renders `[x](docs/gone.md)` inside
#                        backticks as literal text, so there is nothing to click and nothing to
#                        404. Found by this gate flagging the SESSION ENTRY that explains this
#                        gate — prose about links has to quote one, and quoting it tripped the
#                        check. Same shape as the marker docs in ai/STANDARDS.md tripping an
#                        unanchored pattern, and the fix is the rule, not an exemption on a
#                        sentence that was right. Two cases: a span is text, and a real link
#                        beside a span is still checked, because stripping the span must not
#                        take the rest of the line with it.
#   2026-09-08 v0.5.0.20260908.1901 — SECOND PASS: `link_scan()`, because a markdown link is a
#                        promise where prose is only a mention. W-15 moved docs/benchmarks/ out
#                        with localcoder; THREE links in two READMEs kept pointing into this
#                        repo, GitHub rendered all three, and nothing in CI said a word.
#                        Two were found by hand. The THIRD, in tools/README.md, was missed by
#                        the hand check — which globbed README.md and docs/*.md — and found by
#                        this pass on its first run. That gap is the whole argument: a person
#                        sweeps almost everywhere, and almost is where the defect lives.
#                        The pass is narrow on purpose (tracked *.md, prose only, relative
#                        targets only, no network), because a link checker with false positives
#                        is a link checker somebody switches off.
#                        SHIPPED A BUG AND CAUGHT IT BY COUNTING: the first regex excluded any
#                        target containing `#`, so every ANCHORED link went unchecked while the
#                        verdict said fragments were stripped. Counting the tree two ways gave
#                        21 links against the gate's 20. A case now locks it. Anchors themselves
#                        are still NOT checked, and the verdict says so rather than implying it.
#                        Both passes run and neither short-circuits the other — fixing one class
#                        at a time is what CI already makes you do.
#   2026-08-14 v0.4.0.20260814.2100 — `scaffold:path-not-an-instruction` reports its count, and the
#                        file-level count now prints AT ZERO. It used to return early when
#                        nothing was exempted, so the run that proves nothing is being skipped
#                        said nothing at all — the same observation as a broken counter.
#                        A selftest case asserting the OLD behaviour ("no exemptions prints no
#                        suppression block") was inverted rather than deleted, with the
#                        argument kept beside it.
#                        Same macOS awk `-v` path trap as conflict_scan.sh 0.6.0: a log path
#                        beginning with `/` arrives as -inf. ENVIRON[] instead.
#   2026-08-14 v0.3.0 — `scaffold:file-is-historical` GETS THE DEC-18 TREATMENT (Claude Work
#                        §6). It suppressed in silence, which is the thing this file exists to
#                        stop: a whole-FILE exemption is the largest silent reduction the tool
#                        can make — one line at the top of a document turns off every check in
#                        it, forever — and "No instructions reference a missing tools/ path"
#                        read identically whether it skipped nothing or skipped forty files.
#                        I wrote the rule about gates that discover their own work and then
#                        shipped a suppression that does less, quietly.
#                        The count prints on BOTH the pass and the fail path, the files are
#                        named, and a marker with no date and no reason is reported as
#                        incomplete — an exemption without one cannot be told apart from a
#                        line somebody added to make a build go green.
#                        IT STILL SUPPRESSES. Blocking a build to collect a justification is a
#                        guard that gets switched off, and a switched-off guard protects
#                        nothing (ai/SECURITY.md). The nag is proportionate to the ask.
#                        Five cases, both directions: the correct dated-and-reasoned form must
#                        NOT nag, or people delete the reason to quieten it.
#   2026-08-12 v0.2.0 — `scaffold:file-is-historical`, a FILE-scope exemption for documents
#                        that are entirely history — a known-defects log, a decision record.
#                        Marking each line would be seven annotations today and more every
#                        week in a file whose purpose is to accumulate them, and a burden
#                        that grows with the document is one people satisfy by deleting the
#                        check. Found in ai-project-scaffold-dev's 04-KNOWN-DEFECTS.md, where
#                        all seven hits were correct quotations of commands that had produced
#                        real defects. Column 0 only.
#   2026-08-12 v0.1.0 — New. W-15 stopped shipping localcoder and the prose describing it
#                        stayed. That is not merely stale documentation: `chmod +x tools/*.sh
#                        tools/*.py tools/localcoder` shipped in all three of the adoption
#                        guide's copy-paste blocks, and `chmod` exits non-zero on a missing
#                        path — so an adopter's FIRST command ended in an error, at the one
#                        moment they cannot tell "expected" from "I broke it".
#                        SWEPT TWICE AND STILL NOT DONE. 0.36.7 swept `*.md`. 0.36.8 then
#                        found two more inside code — a PRINTED line in `setup.sh --check`
#                        and a workflow comment. A sweep scoped by file EXTENSION is scoped
#                        to the wrong thing, which is D2's shape exactly: a rule enforced
#                        only on changed files is not enforced on what stopped changing.
#                        This file is the checker, so there is no third sweep. Its first run
#                        found three more the two sweeps had missed, including
#                        `preflight --list` printing `tools/audit_localcoder.sh --offline`
#                        as a numbered step to run.

ROOT="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")/.." && pwd)"

# WHY NOT "ANY MENTION OF A MISSING tools/ PATH". Because most mentions are HISTORY, and
# history is the thing this project is built on. Changelogs, release notes and the comments
# that explain why something left all name the departed file ON PURPOSE — docs/TROUBLESHOOTING
# .md deliberately keeps a whole section about `tools/localcoder` so that someone arriving
# from an old CI log is told it is gone rather than finding nothing. A checker that fired on
# those would be turned off within a day, and ai/SECURITY.md's rule is that a guard which
# blocks legitimate work protects nothing afterwards.
#
# So the rule is INSTRUCTIONS, not mentions. Two forms, and both were real defects:
#
#   1. A fenced code block in Markdown. That is a thing to copy and run — `chmod +x ...
#      tools/localcoder`, `tools/guard_delegation.py --selftest`.
#   2. A quoted string in an `echo`/`printf`. That is a thing PRINTED TO A HUMAN as advice —
#      `setup.sh --check`'s summary, and `preflight --list`'s numbered steps.
#
# Prose outside both is left alone. It is allowed to talk about the past.
MARK='scaffold:path-not-an-instruction'

# AND A FILE-SCOPE FORM, for documents that are ENTIRELY history.
#
# A known-defects log, a decision record, a session archive: every command in them is quoted
# because it once ran, and most of what they name is deliberately gone. Marking each line
# would be seven annotations today and more every week, in a file whose whole purpose is to
# accumulate them — and an annotation burden that grows with the document is one people
# eventually satisfy by deleting the check.
#
# Found in ai-project-scaffold-dev on 2026-08-12: 04-KNOWN-DEFECTS.md, seven hits, every one
# a correct quotation of a command that had produced a real defect.
#
# AT COLUMN 0, like every other marker here — an indented example inside a code block is
# documentation, not a declaration. It exempts the WHOLE file, which is a real cost and the
# reason it is a separate, more deliberate marker rather than a laxer default.
FILE_MARK='scaffold:file-is-historical'

# TESTS BUILD TREES ON PURPOSE, and those paths are MEANT not to exist. `header_check.sh`
# writes tools/bare.sh into a temp dir; `adoption_check.sh` writes tools/our_delegate.sh.
# Two ways to tell those apart from a real instruction, and both are needed:
#
#   - STRUCTURAL: skip the body of a function named for a test entry point. Cheap, catches
#     most of them, and needs no annotation.
#   - DECLARED: the line marker above, for fixture builders with project-specific names.
#     A human ruling, visible at the line it applies to — the same shape as
#     `scaffold:not-a-conflict` and `scaffold:not-a-secret`, and for the same reason: a
#     prohibition with no sanctioned path gets worked around, and every workaround is worse.
#
# THE MARKER IS NOT ONLY FOR FIXTURES, and that was learned by running this. Its first real
# run flagged setup.sh's own message EXPLAINING that `tools/localcoder` is gone — history,
# printed to a human, which is precisely what the prose exemption exists for and which the
# printed-string rule cannot distinguish. So the marker says "this line names a missing path
# ON PURPOSE", whichever purpose. That is the same trap the W-15 no-execution gate fell into:
# it fired on setup.sh's echo telling a developer what to install — a gate forbidding its own
# remedy.
# BRACKET EXPRESSIONS, NOT BACKSLASHES. This pattern reaches awk through `-v`, which
# processes escape sequences BEFORE the regex compiler sees them — so `\(\)` arrived as an
# empty group `()` that matches everywhere, and `\{` as a bare brace the compiler reads as
# an interval. The skip silently never fired. `[(][)]` and `[{]` survive both passes.

# SECOND PASS: a markdown LINK is a promise, not a mention.
#
# The pass above deliberately ignores markdown prose — prose is allowed to talk about the

# check that was retired. A LINK is different. A link is not a mention of a file; it is an

# clicks, and gets a 404 with no error anywhere in CI.

# READMEs kept pointing into this repo. Two were found by hand; the third, in tools/README.md,
# was missed by the hand check and found by this pass on its first run. That is the argument
# for the pass: the hand check globbed README.md and docs/*.md, which is exactly the sort of
# almost-complete sweep a person does and a gate does not.
#
# SCOPE, deliberately narrow — a link check with false positives gets switched off:
#   - Tracked *.md only, prose only. A link inside a fence is an EXAMPLE of a link.
#   - Relative targets only. http(s), mailto, tel, ftp, protocol-relative and bare #anchors
#     are somebody else's to verify; this gate does not touch the network.
#   - Anything containing a shell or template metacharacter is a TEMPLATE, not a path.
#   - A #fragment is stripped before resolving. Whether the ANCHOR exists is a different
#     question this does NOT answer, and the verdict says so rather than implying it checked.
