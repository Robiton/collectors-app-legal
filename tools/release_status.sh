# Modified: 2026-09-04
# Version:  0.5.1.20260904.0624
# Purpose:  Say when shipped work has not been released, because an unreleased fix does not exist.
# Changelog:
#   2026-09-04 v0.5.1.20260904.0624 — --selftest could not find its own script in a monorepo-nested adoption.
#                        This file cd's to `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` at load, and SELF was
#                        re-derived from the still-RELATIVE BASH_SOURCE after that cd — so it
#                        looked for tools/ under the repository root, which in an apps/<app>/
#                        adoption has none. SELF became the literal /release_status.sh and all
#                        18 sub-checks failed. INVOKED_FROM is captured before the cd now.
#                        Every fixture here is a repo root, so the shape could not arise.
#   2026-08-16 v0.5.0.20260816.1151 — THE STAMP GATE HAD THE DEFECT IT WAS BUILT TO CATCH (#222,
#                        adopter). HHMM was compared as a STRING while the version key was
#                        compared numerically, and PEP 440 strips a leading zero -- the same
#                        release is 0928 as a git tag and 928 in packaging metadata. "928" <
#                        "1000" is False, so a backwards-ordered release PASSED the gate
#                        whose entire purpose is refusing one.
#                        LATENT ONLY BECAUSE EVERY FIXTURE WAS HAND-PADDED, which is the
#                        exact shape the adopter named: a fixture that encodes the defect it
#                        is meant to catch. The new case is deliberately unpadded and lives
#                        in its own repository so no earlier tag can shadow the baseline.
#                        Reverting to the string comparison now fails three cases.
#   2026-08-16 v0.4.0.20260816.0753 — A BASELINE THAT EXEMPTS EVERYTHING IS INERT, AND THE BASELINE
#                        MUST NOT TRAVEL (adopter report, this repo #220). AGENTS.md SHIPS.
#                        A column-0 declaration in it merged into an adopter with zero tags
#                        and version 0.1.0, where THIS repo's 0.43.0 baseline sits above
#                        every version they will ever cut -- so everything would be exempt
#                        forever and the gate would report on nothing. So: the scaffold
#                        keeps its own baseline in `.version-stamp-baseline`, a file
#                        adopters never receive, and that file outranks the shipped
#                        declaration. AGENTS.md now carries the RULE with an INDENTED
#                        example, which the tool ignores by construction.
#                        And the foreign case is named rather than silently honoured: a
#                        baseline naming no tag here, sitting above the current version, is
#                        reported as a GAP -- it cannot be describing this repo's history.
#   2026-08-15 v0.3.1.20260815.2014 — The baseline marker may carry ANY project prefix, not just
#                        `scaffold:`. localcoder declares `localcoder:version-stamp-baseline`
#                        because it hit this defect first and gates it in its OWN suite,
#                        which is stricter and product-owned. Matching only `scaffold:` made
#                        this report "stamp ordering is NOT checked" in the one repository
#                        that checks it hardest — a false statement whose obvious remedy is
#                        to declare a SECOND baseline, and two copies of one fact is the
#                        defect this tree has now paid for five times. Caught by asking what
#                        the new gate would say in the adopter, before the adopter upgraded.
#   2026-08-15 v0.3.0.20260815.1925 — THE STAMP GATE, ported from localcoder (#113, this repo's #217).
#                        This repository has the defect an adopter reported there: 0.39.5
#                        through 0.42.0 carry stamps one to two days AHEAD of the commits
#                        that made them, so the first release stamped truthfully sorts
#                        EARLIER than its predecessors. It was fixed there and not here, and
#                        it surfaced today by blocking a real release.
#                        BOTH HALVES, because either alone permits it: a stamp may not go
#                        backwards from the newest non-exempt tag, and may not sit in the
#                        future. When the two conflict a release is correctly BLOCKED until
#                        the calendar catches up.
#                        THE BASELINE IS ALSO THE FLOOR. The first release past it has no
#                        non-exempt predecessor, and comparing against an empty set would let
#                        any backdated stamp through — the hole localcoder shipped and had to
#                        close afterwards. Closed here from the start, and asserted.
#                        AN UNDECLARED BASELINE IS A GAP, NOT A PASS: a repo that has not
#                        opted in must not read as checked.
#   2026-08-16 v0.2.0.20260816.0700 — A REPO THAT DECLARES ITS PRODUCT DIRECTORIES IS BELIEVED.
#                        `tools setup.sh templates overlays` were added on top of every
#                        `scaffold:product-dir` declaration, which is the tool disagreeing with
#                        the declaration it just read. In `localcoder`, AGENTS.md states tools/
#                        is the VENDORED GOVERNANCE LAYER and adopters install with
#                        `uv tool install`, so they never receive it — and a vendored-scaffold
#                        upgrade reported a release due, costing a no-op 0.47.1.
#                        Reporting a release owed for a change nobody can receive trains people
#                        to cut releases without reading why, which is the habit that lets a
#                        REAL unreleased fix through. The default is unchanged for a repo that
#                        declares nothing; both arms are asserted, because "believed the
#                        declaration" and "counted nothing" print identically otherwise.
#   2026-08-15 v0.1.0 — New. THE PRODUCER SIDE OF A CHECK THAT ONLY EXISTED FOR CONSUMERS.
#                        `tools/scaffold_version.sh` tells an ADOPTER their vendored copy is
#                        stale. Nothing told the MAINTAINER they had not cut the release that
#                        adopter is waiting for, and the release process was a prose checklist
#                        in ai/PLANNING.md with nothing running it.
#
#                        Measured on 2026-08-14, when someone finally asked:
#                          ai-project-scaffold   9 unreleased commits touching shipped paths
#                          Robiton/localcoder   19 unreleased commits touching shipped paths,
#                                               and a `version` file 13 minor versions ahead
#                                               of the newest tag
#
#                        THE CONSEQUENCE IS NOT UNTIDINESS. `scaffold_upgrade.sh` resolves its
#                        target with `gh release view --json tagName`, so an adopter upgrading
#                        gets the newest RELEASE. Every fix in those commits — including
#                        `ci_status.sh` having never once reported a red CI — was unreachable
#                        by every adopter, and one of those adopters is the programme's primary
#                        review control, which reviews each tagged release.
#
#                        REPORTS, DOES NOT BLOCK, and that is deliberate. A repository is
#                        pushed many times per release; failing a push because a release is due
#                        would train people to bypass the gate, which is how the prose
#                        checklist stopped being read. It exits 1 only when asked to be strict.
set -u

# THE REPOSITORY YOU ARE STANDING IN, not the one this script was copied into. Same rule as
# tools/ci_status.sh, and for a sharper reason here: this file is vendored into every adopting
# project, so resolving from BASH_SOURCE would make an adopter's release status be reported as
# the scaffold's. It also made every selftest fixture below silently run against the real repo
# and report its numbers — six cases passing on the wrong subject, which is the composition
# defect this tree keeps finding.
# NO FALLBACK TO THE SCRIPT'S OWN REPO, and the first version had one. Outside a git tree it
# resolved ROOT from BASH_SOURCE and cheerfully reported the SCAFFOLD's release status to
# someone standing somewhere else — a confident answer about the wrong subject, which is worse
# than refusing. Caught by the case asserting exit 3, which the fallback turned into exit 0.

# ---- THE TWO HALVES OF A VERSION MUST AGREE ABOUT WHICH RELEASE IS NEWER --------------
#
# `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.YYYYMMDD.HHMM` only works if sorting by version and sorting by
# timestamp give the same order. This repository broke that: 0.39.5 through 0.42.0 carry
# stamps one to two days AHEAD of the commits that made them, so the next release stamped
# truthfully sorts EARLIER than its predecessors. An adopter reported the identical defect
# against localcoder as #113, and it was fixed there and not here.
#
# Retagging is not available — those releases are published. So the breach is DECLARED via
# a baseline at column 0 in AGENTS.md, and the invariant is enforced from the next release
# onward. Everything at or below the baseline is exempt, and says so rather than passing
# quietly; everything above it must satisfy both halves.
#
# BOTH HALVES, because either one alone permits the defect: a stamp may not go BACKWARDS
# from the newest non-exempt tag (or ordering breaks) and may not sit in the FUTURE (or the
# next honest release inherits this same trap). When the two conflict, a release is
# correctly BLOCKED until the calendar catches up — which is the only honest state for a
# corpus that already contains a stamp from the future.
#
# THE BASELINE IS ALSO THE FLOOR. The first release past it has no non-exempt predecessor,
# so comparing against an empty set would let any backdated stamp through — a hole found
# and closed in localcoder after the first version shipped with it.
