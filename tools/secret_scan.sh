# Version:  0.10.0.20260904.0824
# Purpose:  Heuristic backstop for committed credentials, with line-scoped exceptions.
# Changelog:
#   2026-09-04 v0.10.0.20260904.0824 — REFERENCE_NAME was snake_case-only, and a code expression cannot hold a
#                        credential (#304). Every alternative required a literal leading
#                        underscore, so `token_url` was suppressed and `tokenUrl` flagged —
#                        same name, different convention. JS, Java, Kotlin, Swift and Go are
#                        camelCase, so the suppressor was effectively OFF for most languages an
#                        adopter brings. Measured on a real repo: 5 findings, all false.
#                        EXPRESSION_VALUE adds the second half — an RHS with no string literal
#                        AND a code operator holds nothing. "No literal" alone would have been
#                        unsafe: API_KEY=sk_live_... is unquoted too, and that is what a .env
#                        looks like. Both guard rails are asserted in the same selftest run.
#   2026-09-03 v0.9.0.20260903.1639 — PROSE IN A MARKDOWN FILE IS NOT A CREDENTIAL (#290).
#                        The value half accepts ANY quoted string of eight characters or more
#                        after a keyword-ish name. In code that is right; in prose it fires on
#                        ordinary English. A sentence reporting a token COUNT followed by a
#                        quoted result turned two commits red, on 2026-09-02 and 09-03 -- the
#                        exact text is in the fixtures, where the scan reads it deliberately
#                        and a marker declares it. Both times it was in a
#                        session log written moments earlier, and both times the fix was to
#                        reword a TRUE sentence to appease a scanner. A check that makes
#                        people edit honest prose is one they learn to route around.
#                        THE DISCRIMINATOR IS NARROW: a value with a SPACE and NO DIGIT, in
#                        .md only. "Tr0ub4dor" has no space, an AWS key has no space, and
#                        "correct horse battery9" has a digit -- all still caught, in Markdown
#                        too. The three other value shapes are untouched everywhere.
#                        What it gives up is a passphrase with spaces and no digit in a
#                        Markdown file, and scaffold:not-a-secret remains the way to declare
#                        anything this gets wrong.
#                        Both fixtures are the EXACT sentences that turned a commit red, plus
#                        three that must still fail: a real secret in Markdown, a spaced value
#                        with a digit, and the same prose in a .py file.
#   2026-08-14 v0.8.0 — EVERY SUPPRESSION REPORTS ITS COUNT, AND ZERO IS THE INTERESTING
#                        VALUE. Four filters stood between a keyword hit and a reported
#                        finding and none of them said how much they removed. The largest is
#                        `scaffold:not-a-secret` — a human declaration that suppresses
#                        SECRET-SCANNER findings — and 25 of them had accumulated one at a
#                        time, each added to quieten a specific line, with nothing ever
#                        reviewing the set. Measured on this tree: 25 adjudicated, 4 reference
#                        names, 1 placeholder, 0 HEC.
#                        PRINTED ON THE GREEN PATH TOO, which is the whole point: "No obvious
#                        secrets found" is the same sentence whether nothing matched or an
#                        allowlist ate every match.
#                        The pipeline is staged rather than chained so each removal is
#                        attributable to ITS filter — four chained greps report one number for
#                        four decisions, and only one of the four is a human decision.
#                        COUNTS GO TO A FILE, NOT A GLOBAL. unadjudicated_lines runs inside
#                        `$( )`, a SUBSHELL, so a global counter would have reported 0 forever
#                        while looking correct — this programme's own favourite defect, very
#                        nearly shipped inside the fix for it.
#   2026-08-09 v0.7.0 — A placeholder VALUE is not a credential: `changeme`, `example`,
#                        `TODO`, or anything ending in `(` — a call, not a value. It earns
#                        its place at any floor, because the QUOTED rule reaches these
#                        shapes whatever the unquoted floor is.
#                        AND IT RECORDS A REVERTED EXPERIMENT. With it, dropping the floor
#                        16 -> 6 scored 14/14 with zero false positives on a 40-line
#                        corpus — then the real repos rejected it: `# ... tokens: Splunk
#                        cannot read them from passwords.conf` is PROSE, and six characters
#                        of a normal word clears a floor of six. ai/MEMORY.md is
#                        deliberately not excluded and is the file most likely to discuss
#                        auth in prose. The corpus measured what I thought of; the repos
#                        found the class I had not. `api_key = abc123` stays missed, now
#                        asserted as a DECISION so nobody re-lowers the floor without
#                        meeting the case.
#   2026-08-09 v0.6.0 — Tuned against a CORPUS instead of a guess: 32 lines of real
#                        credential shapes and real false-positive shapes. Before:
#                        12/14 leaks caught with 2 FALSE POSITIVES. After: 13/14 with 0.
#                        The false positives were mine. 0.16.0 widened the NAME half and
#                        was measured as "zero new findings" against three repos that
#                        happen to contain neither shape — so `api_key_header =
#                        "X-Api-Key"` and `secret_name = "prod/db/creds"` started firing
#                        and nothing said so. A name ending in a reference suffix POINTS
#                        AT a secret and is not one; that is the same indirection
#                        argument that already excludes $VAR and {{ template }} from the
#                        value half.
#                        Unquoted floor 20 -> 16, which is where the last reachable leak
#                        is caught (a 19-char password sat under the old rule by one).
#                        Below 16 gains nothing but noise. `api_key = abc123` stays
#                        missed at six characters, deliberately: gitleaks is the real
#                        tool, and a six-character value is a placeholder far more often
#                        than a credential.
#   2026-08-09 v0.5.0 — The keyword no longer has to TOUCH the separator. A name that
#                        contained a keyword but did not end with one was invisible, so
#                        `aws_secret_access_key = wJalrXUtnFEMI/...` — 40 characters, the
#                        canonical example from AWS's own docs — was reported as "no
#                        obvious secrets found". Every plausible real variable name
#                        carries a suffix: _prod, _v2, _ro, _access_key. Widened to
#                        `[A-Za-z0-9_]*`, which stops at a dot, dash or space, so it
#                        widens the NAME and nothing else — the separator and value rules
#                        are untouched and cannot admit a shape they already reject.
#                        Cost measured across all three real repos before shipping: ZERO
#                        new findings. Four cases, including one proving a suffixed name
#                        is still adjudicable (a widening with no sanctioned way out is
#                        the #127 mistake) and one proving it stops at a word boundary.
#   2026-08-08 v0.4.0 — Read binary files with --text on BOTH halves. Without it grep will
#                        not print matching lines from a file it calls binary, and the two
#                        greps that ship disagree about where that notice goes: BSD grep
#                        (macOS) writes "Binary file X matches" to STDOUT, so the finding
#                        lands and the build fails; GNU grep 3.5+ (every Linux runner)
#                        writes it to STDERR, so the result is EMPTY and the file passes.
#                        A credential pasted into a .p12 or a .pyc therefore failed on a
#                        developer's Mac and was silently cleared by the same scan in CI —
#                        the platform that gates the merge being the blind one. Latent
#                        since v0.1.0; invisible because every fixture was text. The v0.3.0
#                        binary case passed locally and went red on its first Linux run,
#                        which is this repo's only Linux exposure. Output is now stripped
#                        of non-printables: reading binary as text means a match can carry
#                        control bytes, and raw escapes in a log are an injection surface.
#   2026-08-08 v0.3.0 — Prefilter the tree with ONE `git grep` instead of two greps per
#                        tracked file. Measured before the change on a synthetic 5,000-file
#                        repo: 20s, inside a CI job that budgets 5 minutes for every check
#                        it runs. The cost was linear in tracked files and nothing capped
#                        it, so the scan got slower for every adopter as their repo grew,
#                        and the first response to a slow check is to stop running it.
#                        After: 0.09s on the same fixture — 19.7s -> 0.09s, both measured.
#                        THE PREFILTER IS DERIVED FROM THE VERDICT'S OWN PATTERN ($KEYWORDS)
#                        rather than written out beside it, because a second copy of a rule
#                        is how a fix reaches one of them — the failure #96 already cost
#                        this repo twice. A superset prefilter can only cost time, never a
#                        detection; verified by differential test against v0.2.0 over the
#                        full fixture corpus, identical verdicts on every case.
#                        Also: outside a git repo this printed "No obvious secrets found"
#                        and exited 0. It now says it did not run. Same exit code, but the
#                        claim was false and false all-clears are the point of this file.
#   2026-08-08 v0.2.0 — NUL-safe file walk. 0.1.0 built a newline-joined list and walked it
#                        with `for f in $hits`, which word-splits: a tracked file named
#                        `app/my config.py` became two non-existent paths, grep found
#                        nothing in either, and the file PASSED. Measured — a real
#                        `api_key = "sk_live_..."` reported as "No obvious secrets found",  # scaffold:not-a-secret
#                        exit 0. The inline step this replaced failed on a non-empty LIST,
#                        so a mis-split still failed the build; moving the verdict into the
#                        per-file loop is what turned a detection into a silent pass, and a
#                        false negative is the worst outcome a secret scan has. The path now
#                        goes from `git ls-files -z` into the loop and is never a word, and
#                        the exclusion is a `case` rather than a grep over a joined list.
#                        Two selftest cases: every fixture had a tidy path, which is how the
#                        whole class went untested.
#   2026-08-08 v0.1.0 — Lifted out of .github/workflows/scaffold-check.yml so it can be
#                        tested and linted as code (#127). It lived in a `run:` block, and
#                        this repo has already shipped a dropped `fi` that way: bash -n
#                        covers SCRIPT FILES and a workflow is YAML, so the only check on
#                        it was a proxy. As a file it gets --selftest, and CI discovers
#                        that the same way it discovers every other tool's.
#                        Behaviour change in the same move: exceptions are adjudicated per
#                        LINE, so `# scaffold:not-a-secret` or an existing `# nosec` clears
#                        one line without excluding a file. Extracting it immediately paid
#                        for itself — writing the fixtures found that reading matched lines
#                        case-SENSITIVELY while the file list is built case-INsensitively,
#                        which silently passed every file it was supposed to examine.
set -u

ROOT="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")/.." && pwd)"

# A LEAK IS word + separator + a LITERAL VALUE. An earlier pattern ended in `[=: ]`, whose
# character class contains a BARE SPACE, so any prose where one of these words was followed
# by a space failed the build — including a line documenting CSRF handling, and the note
# written to describe the trap. ai/MEMORY.md is deliberately not excluded and is also the
# file most likely to discuss auth in prose, so it fired on exactly the wrong file.
#
# Values that are REFERENCES — $VAR, ${VAR}, {{ template }}, <placeholder> — are
# indirection, not secrets. Flagging them teaches people to ignore the check.
#
# SPLIT IN TWO SO THE PREFILTER CANNOT DRIFT FROM THE VERDICT. scan() needs a cheap way to
# find candidate files across the whole tree (see there for why), and the only safe
# prefilter is one that is a STRICT SUPERSET of the real pattern. Deriving both from the
# same $KEYWORDS makes that a property of the source rather than a promise in a comment:
# every line PATTERN can match begins with a KEYWORDS match, so a file the prefilter skips
# provably has nothing for the verdict to find.
KEYWORDS='(password|passwd|api_key|apikey|secret_key|secret|token|bearer)'

# THE KEYWORD DOES NOT HAVE TO TOUCH THE SEPARATOR, AND REQUIRING IT TO MISSED THE MOST
# RECOGNISABLE SECRET THERE IS.
#
# Until 0.15.3 the pattern went straight from $KEYWORDS to `[=:]`, so a name that CONTAINED
# a keyword but did not END with one was invisible. Measured:
#
#     aws_secret_access_key = wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY   MISSED  # scaffold:not-a-secret
#     github_token_ro       = ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx                   MISSED  # scaffold:not-a-secret
#     secret = "Tr0ub4dor"                                               caught  # scaffold:not-a-secret
#
# Those three lines carry the marker because THIS SCAN NOW READS THEM, which it could not
# do before the widening — the checker firing on its own rulebook, one commit after the
# rule changed. That is the shape #127 was about, and the line-scoped marker is the
# sanctioned way out rather than excluding the file or contorting the example.
#
# The AWS one is the canonical example from AWS's own documentation. A scan that reports
# "no obvious secrets" over a committed AWS secret key is the false all-clear ai/PLANNING.md
# rates as strictly worse than a false positive, and every plausible variable name in real
# code carries a suffix: _prod, _v2, _ro, _access_key.
#
# `[A-Za-z0-9_]*` ONLY — no dots, no dashes, no spaces. It widens the NAME and nothing else:
# the separator and the value half are untouched, so this cannot admit a shape the value
# rules already rejected. Cost measured before shipping, across all three real repos
# (scaffold, its dev context, localcoder): ZERO new findings. The widening is close to free
# because it discriminates on a part of the line that was never doing any work.

# A HUMAN ALREADY RULED ON THIS LINE (#127).
#
# #120 widened this scan from ai/ to the whole tracked tree, which is correct and is what
# made real source reachable. It also made a shape close to boilerplate fail: a Flask or
# Django config module carrying
#     _DEFAULT_SECRET = 'dev-secret-key-change-in-production'  # scaffold:not-a-secret
# is word + separator + literal, so it matches, and the value genuinely IS a literal so it
# always will. Measured on a real 0.6.3 -> 0.11.3 upgrade: CI went red on a line untouched
# for years that already carried `# nosec B105`, because bandit flagged it once and a human
# ruled on it then.
#
# The three available responses were all bad. Renaming the variable to dodge the regex
# contorts source to satisfy a checker and leaves the next person free to rename it back.
# Excluding the file is a hole — the argument the HEC exception already makes. Appending
# `|| echo ::warning::` makes the whole scan advisory, and this repo argues everywhere that
# a warning nobody acts on is indistinguishable from no check. None of them was "declare
# that this line was reviewed and is fine", and a prohibition with no sanctioned path gets
# worked around — which is exactly where the HEC rule was before it got one.
#
# `# nosec` is honoured beside the scaffold marker because it is line-scoped by
# construction and ALREADY means a human reviewed this line; B105 is literally
# hardcoded_password_string. Demanding a second, different marker next to it would be
# ceremony, not safety.
ADJUDICATED='scaffold:not-a-secret|(^|[^A-Za-z0-9_])nosec([^A-Za-z0-9_]|$)'

# A NAME ENDING IN ONE OF THESE POINTS AT A SECRET; IT IS NOT ONE.
#
# `api_key_header = "X-Api-Key"` is an HTTP header name. `secret_name = "prod/db/creds"` is
# a lookup key for a vault. Both are quoted literals over eight characters, so the value
# rules match them, and after 0.16.0 widened the NAME half they matched there too — the
# widening that was measured as "zero new findings" against three repos that happen to
# contain neither shape. Measured properly against a 32-line corpus of real credential
# shapes and real false-positive shapes: 2 false positives, both of this form, both gone
# when the suffix is excluded.
#
# THE COST OF A FALSE POSITIVE HERE IS THE WHOLE CHECK. #127 is the record: one boilerplate
# line failing a build produced three bad options and nearly got the scan switched off.
# These suffixes are the shapes where the variable name itself says "this is a reference",
# and a reference is indirection — the same reason `$VAR` and `{{ template }}` are excluded
# from the value half.
# A VALUE THAT IS A PLACEHOLDER OR A CALL IS NOT A CREDENTIAL, and saying so is what made
# the short-value floor affordable at all.
#
# It earns its place at ANY floor, because the quoted-value rule reaches these shapes too:
# `password = "changeme123"` is eleven quoted characters and matches whatever the unquoted
# floor is. #127 is the record of what ONE such false positive costs — three bad options and
# a scan nearly switched off.
#

# Dropping the unquoted floor 16 -> 6 catches `api_key = abc123`, the last leak in the
# corpus, and with this exclusion it scored 14/14 with zero false positives. Then the real
# repos rejected it: four findings, and the decisive one was
#     # commit HEC receiver tokens: Splunk cannot read them from passwords.conf
# — ordinary PROSE, where `tokens:` is followed by six characters of a normal word. That is
# the exact failure the pattern's own history records (`[=: ]` once contained a bare space
# and failed the build on a line about CSRF), and `ai/MEMORY.md` is deliberately not excluded
# and is the file most likely to discuss auth in prose.
#
# The corpus had 40 lines and not one of them was prose with a colon. It measured what I
# thought of; the real repos found the class I had not. Floor stays at 16 and
# `api_key = abc123` stays missed at six characters — deliberately, and now with a second
# reason: gitleaks is the real tool, and the alternative costs the whole check.
#
# It matches the VALUE, never the name — a variable called `password` holding a real secret
# is still caught; only a value that announces itself as a stand-in is cleared.

# ==== PROSE IN A MARKDOWN FILE IS NOT A CREDENTIAL (#290) ===================================
#
# The value half accepts `"[^"$<{][^"]{7,}"` — ANY quoted string of eight characters or more
# after a keyword-ish name. In code that is right; in prose it fires on ordinary English:
#
#     4 generated tokens: "No issues found."   # scaffold:not-a-secret
#
# (That example line carries the marker because THIS SCAN READS IT — a `.sh` file, so the
# Markdown-only suppression below does not apply to it. The checker firing on its own
# rulebook is the same shape the AWS example above records, and the line-scoped marker is
# the sanctioned way out rather than contorting the example.)
#
# `tokens` matches the name, `: ` the separator, and the sentence the value. That exact line
# turned two commits red on 2026-09-02 and 2026-09-03, both times in a session log I had just
# written, and both times the fix was to reword a true sentence to appease a scanner. A check
# that makes people edit honest prose is one they learn to route around.
#
# THE DISCRIMINATOR IS NARROW ON PURPOSE: a value containing a SPACE and NO DIGIT, in a
# Markdown file only. Secrets do not look like that.
#
#     "No issues found."              space, no digit   -> prose
#     "Tr0ub4dor"                     no space          -> still caught
#     "correct horse battery9"        space AND digit   -> still caught
#     wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPx...    no space          -> still caught
#
# SCOPED TO .md, AND ONLY THE QUOTED-STRING ALTERNATIVE. The three other value shapes — the
# long unbroken token, the letters-with-a-digit run, and the single-quoted form — are
# untouched everywhere, so a real credential pasted into a session log is still found. A
# passphrase with spaces AND no digit in a Markdown file is the one thing this gives up, and
# `scaffold:not-a-secret` remains the way to declare anything this gets wrong.
PROSE_VALUE='[=:][[:space:]]*"[^"0-9]*[[:space:]][^"0-9]*"[[:space:]]*$'

# EVERY ALTERNATIVE REQUIRED A LITERAL LEADING UNDERSCORE, so this only ever fired on
# snake_case. `token_url` was suppressed and `tokenUrl` was flagged — same name, same
# meaning, different convention. JavaScript, Java, Kotlin, Swift and Go are camelCase by
# convention, so the suppressor was effectively OFF for most of the languages an adopter
# brings. Measured on a real repo: five findings, all false, one of them
# `this._tokenUrl = '/.netlify/functions/google-token'` — a name that names a URL, which is
# precisely what this exists to suppress.
#
# `([_-]|[a-z0-9])` accepts the camelCase boundary as well as the underscore, and the grep
# is already -i so the capitalised half matches. The word list is unchanged: these are
# REFERENCE words only. `password`, `token` and `secret` are deliberately absent from it,
# so widening the boundary cannot suppress a real credential name.

# A CREDENTIAL NEEDS A LITERAL TO LIVE IN. Three of that same repo's five findings assigned
# a plain host-language expression with no string anywhere on the right-hand side:
#
#     ERR_MISSING_TOKEN = ERROR_CODES_BASE + 16;                      arithmetic
#     offerToken = productIdAndOfferIndexArray[1];                    subscript
#     offerToken = subscriptionOfferDetails.get(0).getOfferToken();   method call
#
# None of those can hold a secret. But "no quotes on the RHS" is NOT a safe rule on its own:
# `API_KEY=sk_live_abc123` is a real credential and is also unquoted, which is the ordinary  # scaffold:not-a-secret
# shape of a .env file. So this requires BOTH no string literal AND an operator that only
# appears in code — a call, a subscript or arithmetic. A bare unquoted value stays flagged.

# ==== EVERY SUPPRESSION REPORTS ITS COUNT, AND ZERO IS THE INTERESTING VALUE ================
#
# Four filters stand between a keyword hit and a reported finding, and until now NONE of them
# said how much they removed. That is the worst place in this tree for it: the largest is
# `scaffold:not-a-secret`, a human declaration that suppresses SECRET-SCANNER findings, and 33
# of them accumulated one at a time, each added to quieten a specific line, with nothing ever
# reviewing the set.
#
# The distinguishing test, from design review 2026-08-14 and worded by them because my own
# version readmitted everything it had just excluded: **report a suppression when a human
# declared it, or when the set it removes could change a figure the tool reports.** Skipping
# `node_modules` is machinery and stays silent; all four below can move a finding count.
#
# ZERO IS WHY THIS IS PRINTED UNCONDITIONALLY. "No obvious secrets found" reads identically
# whether nothing matched or whether an allowlist quietly ate every match, and those want
# opposite actions. A count of 0 adjudications on a clean tree is the reassuring case; a count
# of 33 on a clean tree is a finding about the allowlist.
#
# COUNTS GO TO A FILE, NOT A GLOBAL. unadjudicated_lines is called inside `$( )`, which is a
# SUBSHELL — a variable incremented there is discarded the moment it returns, so a global
# counter would have reported 0 forever while looking entirely correct. That is this
# programme's own favourite defect and it would have shipped inside the fix for it.

  # -i IS LOAD-BEARING AND MUST MATCH THE FILE SELECTION. The file list is built with
  # `grep -liE`, so `_DEFAULT_SECRET` matches `secret` — that case-insensitivity is the
  # whole reason #127's line was reachable at all. Reading the file case-SENSITIVELY here
  # found no lines, left this empty, and passed the file: a silent false negative that
  # reports success for work it did not do. Found by running fixtures, not by reading.
  # -a IS THE OTHER HALF, AND WITHOUT IT THIS SCAN'S ANSWER DEPENDED ON THE OPERATING
  # SYSTEM. Without --text, grep refuses to print matching lines from a file it decides is
  # binary. BSD grep (macOS) announces "Binary file X matches" on STDOUT, which lands in
  # $remain and fails the build; GNU grep 3.5+ (every Linux CI runner) writes the same
  # notice to STDERR, so $remain came back EMPTY and the file passed.
  #
  # So a credential pasted into a .p12, a .pyc, a keystore — anything git calls binary —
  # was reported by this scan on a developer's Mac and silently cleared by the same scan in
  # CI. That is worse than either behaviour on its own: the platform that gates the merge
  # was the blind one. Latent since v0.1.0 and invisible to the fixtures, because every
  # fixture file was text; the case added in v0.3.0 passed locally and failed on the first
  # Linux run, which is the only exposure this repo has (the `mktemp -t` lesson again).
  #
  # EVERY GREP IN THE PIPELINE NEEDS IT, NOT JUST THE FIRST. The matched line still carries
  # the NUL bytes that made the file binary, so the NEXT grep re-runs the same detection on
  # its own stdin and suppresses the line again — "Binary file (standard input) matches",
  # which is neither a finding nor a pass. Found by the differential harness, not by
  # reading: the first fix moved the failure one process to the right.
  #
  # --text makes both platforms read the bytes. The pattern needs keyword + separator +
  # literal, which random binary content does not produce by accident, and scan() strips
  # non-printables before anything reaches a log.
  # STAGE BY STAGE, so each filter's removal is attributable to IT rather than to the
  # pipeline. Chained greps report one number for four decisions, which is the same reason
  # this scan reads each gotcha source separately: a total is reassuring in exactly the case
  # that is broken.
