# Modified: 2026-09-06
# Version:  0.9.1.20260906.0600
# Purpose:  Answer "has anything we borrowed from moved since we looked at it?" — which a
#           registry with no upstream fingerprint in it cannot answer at all.
# Changelog:
#   2026-09-06 v0.9.1.20260906.0600 — issue_refs_check is scoped OUT of --file runs. It emits `[??]`
#                        lines and the UNREACHABLE assertion counts them, so running it
#                        against a fixture registry turned a 1 into a 2. Caught by
#                        adoption_check in a synthetic adoption -- a gate I added broke an
#                        adopter's preflight, and the adoption fixture is the only thing
#                        that would have told me before they did. Asserted directly now.
#   2026-09-06 v0.9.0.20260906.0554 — A CITED ISSUE NUMBER ABOVE THE MAXIMUM WAS INVENTED (#303).
#                        Same question this file asks of upstream, pointed inward. FOUR
#                        fabricated forward-references were in the tree, all written on
#                        2026-09-04 as plausible next numbers for work never filed; a reader
#                        chasing one finds nothing and the reasoning is unrecoverable.
#                        THE FIRST CUT WAS WRONG AND THE WAY IT WAS WRONG IS THE DESIGN.
#                        Resolving every reference against the issue list reported NINE
#                        missing on a clean tree, because `localcoder#201` and bare prose
#                        like "measured in #147" cite ANOTHER tracker. Stripping the repo
#                        prefix fixes the qualified ones and cannot fix the bare ones -- the
#                        ambiguity is in the source text. A 9-to-1 false-positive rate is how
#                        a gate teaches people to scroll past it.
#                        So it flags ONLY numbers ABOVE the current maximum, which cannot be
#                        a shared cross-repo number and cannot be an old closed issue: it can
#                        only be invented. Catches all four real instances with zero false
#                        positives, and knowingly misses a fabrication below the maximum.
#                        Narrow and trustworthy beats broad and ignored.
#                        And it flagged its OWN comment naming the examples, so those are
#                        written without the sigil -- the paragraph explaining a guard
#                        otherwise satisfies the guard.
#   2026-08-30 v0.2.1.20260830.0005 — THE LOCAL WARNINGS NO LONGER SIT BEHIND A NETWORK CALL, and
#                        the selftest now PLANTS DEFECTS instead of only exercising helpers.
#                        An unreachable source hit `continue` before the licence and floor
#                        checks, so "licence unverified -- resolve before copying anything"
#                        was suppressed for precisely the rows that need it loudest: a repo
#                        renamed, deleted or made private is the one whose terms nobody can go
#                        and read. Both checks need no network and now run regardless, via
#                        local_row_warnings() so the two call sites cannot drift. Eight
#                        mutation tests assert each defect is REPORTED and that a clean row
#                        manufactures nothing -- everything here previously proved the parser
#                        worked on GOOD input and nothing proved the tool catches anything.
#   2026-08-26 v0.2.0 — `floor` SPLIT OUT FROM `reviewed`, because the first version conflated
#                        two different questions under one column and described the result as a
#                        "pin". The owner caught it. `reviewed` is HISTORY -- the version our
#                        evidence was taken on, which must never move or the evidence stops
#                        being interpretable. `floor` is POLICY -- the minimum we require,
#                        written `>=X`, because an exact pin claims one version is acceptable
#                        and goes stale the day upstream ships a fix.
#                        THE THIRD STATE IS THE USEFUL ONE: `reviewed` BELOW `floor` means our
#                        measurements predate the rule we adopted. Nothing has drifted and
#                        neither field is wrong, and nothing else in the tree can say it.
#                        Live example: ollama reviewed v0.32.13, floor >=0.32.15 -- two MLX
#                        dependency updates and a caching rewrite sit in between, under #147,
#                        #191, #117 and every T2/T2b number.
#                        `--write` refreshes reviewed and checked and NEVER floor: a tool that
#                        moved a policy would be granting itself permission.
#                        Fingerprint kind is inferred from what was recorded -- a SHA opts into
#                        commit tracking. cline ships `desktop-v*` and `sdk/*` tags from one
#                        tree, so its "latest release" flips between product lines and reported
#                        MOVED within the hour while meaning nothing.
#   2026-08-26 v0.1.1 — Header corrected: it claimed "preflight does not call this", which is
#                        both wrong and the reason CI went red. preflight case 1b-vii fails a
#                        tool that ships --check with no gate calling it, and this is now wired
#                        exactly as session_currency.sh is -- called every run, exits 0, exit 1
#                        only under --strict. Being CALLED and being ABLE TO FAIL A PUSH are
#                        different things, and the first draft conflated them.
#   2026-08-26 v0.1.0 — Initial. This programme had a "worth a second look" pile
#                        (localcoder-dev/docs/SKILLS-AND-TOOLS-IDEAS.md) recording source,
#                        licence and status — everything except the one field that makes
#                        revisiting possible. Nothing recorded WHICH COMMIT we read, so
#                        "have they fixed anything since?" had no answer short of reading
#                        the whole repo again from scratch.
#
# THIS IS A REPORT, NOT A GATE, AND THAT IS DELIBERATE
#   An upstream repository moving is the NORMAL case — active projects push daily. A
#   preflight gate that goes red every time someone else commits is red at a normal moment,
#   and ai-project-scaffold#241 is this month's example of what that trains: people learn to
#   scroll past it, and then it is worth nothing when it finally means something.
#   So `--check` REPORTS drift and exits 0. `--strict` returns the drift as an exit code for
#   a scheduled review that wants to act on it.
#
#   preflight DOES call it, in --check mode, and that is not a contradiction: the same wiring
#   session_currency.sh has. The scaffold's own rule (preflight case 1b-vii) is that a tool
#   shipping --check with no gate calling it is selftest-green and unused, and the first draft
#   of this header asserted the opposite on the way to failing CI for exactly that reason.
#   Being CALLED by a gate and being ABLE TO FAIL a push are different things.
#
# WHY THE LICENCE COLUMN IS LOAD-BEARING
#   `trailofbits/skills` is CC-BY-SA-4.0: forking the repo for reference is fine, copying its
#   SKILL.md text into our `.claude/skills/` drags share-alike into private repositories.
#   That distinction lives in the row, next to the thing it governs, because a licence
#   recorded somewhere else is a licence nobody reads at the moment of copying.
#
# WHAT A ROW MUST CARRY, and why each field is not optional
#   source    owner/repo. A search URL is not a source — record it as `unresolved:<note>`
#             so it shows up as work to do rather than as a tracked dependency.
#   licence   what it permits. `unverified` is a legitimate value and prints as a warning.
#   relation  code | idea | behaviour | evaluated | catalogue | dependency
#             `behaviour` is the one people forget: we did not take Cline's code, we read its
#             shipped bundle and depend on what we found there. An upstream change to that
#             behaviour breaks us exactly as a code change would.
#   took      what we actually took, in a few words.
#   landed    where it is in OUR tree — a file, a tool, an issue number. This is the blast
#             radius when the upstream moves, and it is the field that makes the report
#             actionable rather than merely interesting.
#   reviewed  the upstream fingerprint AT THE TIME WE LOOKED. Short SHA, or a release tag.
#             THIS IS HISTORY AND IT NEVER MOVES ON ITS OWN. Every measurement we hold about
#             a source is only interpretable against the version it was taken on; rewriting
#             this to "current" silently converts a dated fact into an undated claim.
#   floor     the MINIMUM version we require, as `>=X`, or `-` if we do not constrain it.
#             THIS IS A POLICY AND IT IS DELIBERATELY NOT A PIN. An exact pin says one
#             version is acceptable, which is almost never what is meant and goes stale the
#             day upstream ships a fix. A floor says "below this we know we are broken".
#             The two fields answer different questions and both are needed: `reviewed`
#             says what our evidence rests on, `floor` says what we will run.
#   checked   ISO date we last looked.

usage: provenance_check.sh [--check|--write|--list] [--strict] [--file PATH]

  --check    (default) report which upstream sources have moved since we recorded them.
             Exits 0 — drift is normal, not a failure. Add --strict to exit 1 on drift.
  --write    refresh the ref/checked columns to the CURRENT upstream state. Run this only
             after you have actually reviewed what changed; it is a statement that you
             looked, and writing it without looking makes the whole registry a lie.
  --list     print the registry rows with no network calls.

The registry is ai/PROVENANCE.md, between the scaffold:provenance markers.

# ==== A CITED ISSUE NUMBER ABOVE THE HIGHEST ONE THAT EXISTS WAS INVENTED (#303) =========
#
# Same question this file already asks, pointed inward: we cite issue numbers as the
# justification for a change, and nothing checked they are real. Measured 2026-09-06: FOUR
# fabricated forward-references -- numbers 303, 304, 305 and 307, written WITHOUT the sigil
# here because a paragraph explaining a guard otherwise satisfies the guard -- all written
# on 2026-09-04 as
# plausible next numbers for work never filed. A reader chasing one finds nothing and the
# reasoning is unrecoverable. Same class as 0.84.0's nineteen dangling pointers.
#
# IT FLAGS ONLY NUMBERS ABOVE THE CURRENT MAXIMUM, and that is the whole design. The first
# cut resolved every reference against the issue list and reported nine missing on a clean
# tree -- because `localcoder#201`, and bare prose like "measured in #147", cite ANOTHER
# repository's tracker. Stripping the repo prefix fixes the qualified ones and cannot fix the
# bare ones; the ambiguity is in the source text, not the pattern. A gate with a 9-to-1
# false-positive rate is one people learn to scroll past, which is worse than no gate.
#
# A number ABOVE the maximum is unambiguous: it cannot be a cross-repo reference we happen to
# share, and it cannot be an old closed issue. It can only be a number someone made up. That
# is exactly the defect -- all four instances were forward-references -- caught with no false
# positives, at the cost of not catching a fabricated number that happens to fall below the
# maximum. Narrow and trustworthy beats broad and ignored.
#
# ONE NETWORK CALL. NOT MEASURED IS NOT A PASS.
