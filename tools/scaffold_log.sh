# Modified: 2026-08-31
# Version:  0.3.1.20260831.0904
# Purpose:  Record that a check RAN, so a check that stops running is visible.
# Changelog:
#   2026-08-31 v0.3.1.20260831.0904 — #251 '\\t' in a BRE is an escaped t, not a tab, on GNU grep and ugrep -- the assertion failed
#                        while the row it sought was present. Pattern now built with printf.
#   2026-08-19 v0.3.0 — A QUIET KEY HAS THREE CAUSES AND ONLY ONE IS AN ALARM. Every quiet
#                        key printed the same 'check stopped running'. Measured here: FIVE
#                        were about to fire on 2026-08-24 and NONE was a real silence --
#                        four tools that left in the W-15 split, plus `preflight:lint_python.sh`
#                        frozen at 30 runs while `preflight:ruff, pinned (tools/lint_python.sh)`
#                        had 244 and ran that morning: one check, two keys, because
#                        RELABELLING A GATE STARTS A NEW SERIES. Five wolf cries in the one
#                        report whose job is detecting silence teaches the reader to skip it.
#                        Now split into SILENT (still here, stopped — the finding), RELABELLED
#                        (a live key names the same tool) and RETIRED (not in the tree), with
#                        `--retire` to tombstone by APPENDING, never by rewriting.
#                        THE WALK BUG WAS THE DANGEROUS ONE: it covered tools/ops/src only, so
#                        `sync-check.sh` — top-level, the SessionStart hook, precisely what this
#                        report exists to catch — was filed as 'not an alarm'. Over-reporting
#                        costs a glance; under-reporting is this tool failing at its one job.
#                        A label with no filename in it stays in the alarming column for the
#                        same reason. retire() is a FUNCTION so --selftest exercises the
#                        shipped path: the first tombstone case re-implemented the append in
#                        the fixture and a delete-instead-of-append mutation passed it.
#   2026-08-09 v0.2.0 — `--report` shows runs per week, so it can answer "is this getting
#                        better or worse" and not only "what is true right now". A single
#                        snapshot cannot tell a check that is fading from one that has
#                        always been occasional.
#                        THE BUCKETING WAS DRAFTED BY tools/localcoder — the first real use
#                        of the routing rule this release added. It passed 7/7 against
#                        cases written after the fact (empty weeks, unparseable input,
#                        week-boundary alignment) and review changed exactly one thing: the
#                        draft returned `(None, 0)` for empty input, so a caller printing
#                        the label got "None". Dates are always computable; only counts can
#                        be zero. That one fix is what the agent half of the split is for.
#   2026-08-09 v0.1.0 — New. Every check in this toolchain prints to a console that is then
#                        thrown away, so nothing anywhere records that a check RAN. That is
#                        not a gap in reporting; it is the reason this project's dominant
#                        failure mode is invisible.
#                        Measured on 2026-08-09: FOUR hooks — sync-check at SessionStart and
#                        the journal at SessionStart, Stop and SessionEnd — had never fired
#                        once on the machine that develops this scaffold, because they
#                        resolved paths against the working directory and sessions open in
#                        the parent of three repos. Months. Nothing said so, and nothing
#                        could have: silence is what a passing check and a check that never
#                        ran both look like.
#                        The same week: sync-check's archive nudge branched on an exit code
#                        that had stopped being returned (five releases dead), and CI printed
#                        "12 tool selftest suite(s) passed" in green while a 15-case suite
#                        was skipped for a missing mode bit.
#                        A verdict is not the useful signal here. THE TIMESTAMP IS.
