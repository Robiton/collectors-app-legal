# Modified: 2026-09-08
# Version:  0.6.0.20260908.0242
# Purpose:  Compare the canonical skills tree against the Claude Code mirror, and say
#           what actually drifted and which direction the fix runs.
# Changelog:
#   2026-09-08 v0.6.0.20260908.0242 — IT SAYS THAT IT RAN, AND WHAT IT DID NOT MEASURE. Exiting 0
#                        in silence made a clean run indistinguishable from a run that never
#                        happened -- the [GAP]-versus-[PASS] shape this project keeps paying
#                        for. And a bare success invited the reader to hear an outcome claim
#                        the check never made: it proves two trees match and frontmatter
#                        parses, and proves NOTHING about whether a skill is selected when it
#                        should be or helps when it is.
#                        Prompted by tjboudreaux/cc-thinking-skills, whose eval harness
#                        separates structural conformance from outcome, and whose authors --
#                        having actually measured -- deleted 11 of their 39 skills and
#                        authorised no claim that the remaining 28 work. Someone else
#                        arriving independently at this project's own recurring defect.
#                        Verbose path only; --quiet and the exit code are unchanged, so
#                        setup.sh and adoption_check are untouched.
#   2026-09-07 v0.5.0.20260907.0959 — PRESENT ON DISK IS NOT PRESENT IN THE REPOSITORY.
#                        This tool compares two FILESYSTEM trees, so a mirror created
#                        locally and never committed passed here and failed everywhere
#                        else. Measured in Robiton/collectionapp: exit 0 on the authoring
#                        machine while CI's adoption gate reported `skills mirror drifted`,
#                        because nothing under .claude/ was tracked at all. The file was
#                        correct and invisible -- and the local pass is what made it look
#                        like a CI problem rather than a missing commit.
#                        Same family as the executable-bit rule this project records:
#                        assert against the INDEX, because the working tree is the one
#                        place a file is guaranteed to look right. `[ -f ]` answers 'did
#                        somebody create this'; the question is 'will anyone else get it'.
#                        ADVISORY and git-gated -- mid-authoring is legitimate and a
#                        non-checkout is not a defect. Mutation-verified both directions.
#   2026-08-23 v0.4.0 — IT VERIFIED THE COPIES MATCHED AND NEVER ASKED WHETHER THE THING BEING
#                        COPIED WAS A SKILL. Found in Robiton/localcoder 2026-08-23:
#                        delegate/SKILL.md had NO YAML frontmatter in either home -- both
#                        copies identical, both invalid, and this script called that pair
#                        clean. Claude Code documents frontmatter as required and uses
#                        `description` to decide when to load a skill AUTOMATICALLY, so a
#                        skill without one can never be auto-invoked. `/delegate` still
#                        worked from the directory name, which is why nobody noticed.
#                        The skill in question exists because "the measured failure is not
#                        that delegation goes badly, it is that it never starts". It could
#                        not start.
#                        Now checks, on the CANONICAL side only: frontmatter at line 1,
#                        a non-empty name:, a non-empty description:, and name matching the
#                        directory -- the directory is what becomes the command, so a name
#                        that disagrees is a label pointing at a different skill. Checking
#                        both homes would report every fault twice and imply they were two.
#                        Three selftest cases for it, because every other fixture here is now
#                        VALID -- without them the check never fires in the suite and could be
#                        deleted with everything still green.
#                        Also: "8 selftest case(s) passed" was a LITERAL. It stayed 8 while
#                        eleven cases ran. Counted now.
#   2026-08-06 v0.2.1 — The blank-line collapse was too broad, and the negative case could
#                        not see it. `\n{3,}` -> `\n\n` flattens whitespace inside FENCED CODE
#                        too, so a canonical skill with PEP 8 two-blank-line spacing and a
#                        mirror that had lost one compared EQUAL — real drift, silently
#                        missed, which is this tool own defect facing the other way. Case 2
#                        differs by TEXT so it passed either way. Now only the newlines
#                        adjacent to the removed block are consumed; nothing else is touched.
#   2026-08-06 v0.2.0 — Collapse the blank lines a stripped localcoder block leaves behind
#                        (#97), and add --selftest. Stripping removed the block and left
#                        the whitespace around it, so two semantically identical skills
#                        still differed and the check reported drift. The damage was in
#                        the REMEDY, not the false positive: `cp -R .agents/skills/.
#                        .claude/skills/` clears it by copying the localcoder block into
#                        the agent-facing mirror — precisely what stripping exists to
#                        prevent — and the check then goes green, so the wrong fix looks
#                        like the right one. At least one adopter has already applied it.
#                        The 7 selftest cases are the missing half: the old code passed
#                        "does it strip the block" and nothing asked "do two files
#                        differing only by a block compare equal".
#   2026-08-04 v0.1.0 — Initial creation
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS AS ITS OWN SCRIPT
#   sync-check.sh and setup.sh both had their own `diff -rq` plus their own advice, and
#   both were wrong in the same two ways. One definition, called by both — the same
#   reason tools/session_archive.py owns the archive count.
#
# TWO DEFECTS IT FIXES
#   1. A `localcoder:begin` block in a canonical SKILL.md is an INTENTIONAL divergence.
#      It is drafting guidance for a local model; localcoder reads it from .agents/, and
#      copying it into the agent-facing mirror just injects noise into a context that will
#      never act on it. The old check reported drift every single session, and its
#      suggested fix made things slightly worse. Those blocks are now stripped from both
#      sides before comparing.
#   2. `cp -R .agents/skills/. .claude/skills/` ADDS and OVERWRITES; it never removes.
#      When the mirror held adopter-authored skills the canonical side lacked — five of
#      them in one real project — the suggested command changed nothing and the warning
#      fired again next session. A warning whose fix does not work is a warning people
#      learn to ignore, and this one shares a channel with the un-distilled-journal
#      warning, which genuinely matters.
#
# Usage:
#   tools/skills_check.sh            # human-readable diagnosis; exit 1 if drifted
#   tools/skills_check.sh --quiet    # exit code only

# ==== SAY THAT IT RAN, AND SAY WHAT IT DID NOT MEASURE ====================================
#
# Two problems with exiting 0 in silence, and this project has recorded both elsewhere.
#
# FIRST: a check that prints nothing when clean is indistinguishable from a check that never
# ran. That is the same shape as `[GAP]` versus `[PASS]`, and as a repository with no CI
# reading identically to one that is green.
#
# SECOND, and the reason this line names it: THIS MEASURES STRUCTURE, NOT OUTCOME. It proves
# two trees match and that frontmatter parses. It proves nothing about whether a skill is
# selected when it should be, or helps when it is. Prompted by tjboudreaux/cc-thinking-skills
# (registered 2026-09-08), whose eval harness separates exactly these -- "does the file have
# the right headers" from "does it improve reasoning and fire at the right time" -- and whose
# authors, having measured, DELETED 11 of 39 of their own skills and authorised no claim that
# the rest work. A structural check reporting a bare success invites the reader to hear the
# outcome claim it never made.
