# Changelog:
#   2026-09-06 v0.20.2.20260906.0406 — --check NAMES THE CEILING THAT BINDS (#302). The [ok]
#                        line reported the LINE ceiling only, so a reader watching "785 / 800
#                        lines" read that as comfortable while the file sat ~450 chars from an
#                        [over]. In a dense repository the CHARACTER ceiling is the one that
#                        actually trips -- measured three times in one adopting repo in two
#                        days, on MEMORY.md twice and BACKLOG.md once, and the 800-line ceiling
#                        was never approached in any of them. The information already existed
#                        on the [over] line; it was simply invisible until after the surprise.
#                        Now both are shown with the binding one named and its headroom given.
#   2026-09-02 v0.20.1.20260902.0359 — THE REVISIT DETECTOR MATCHED A FORM NOBODY WRITES
#                        (#284). The pattern demanded the word immediately after the bullet.
#                        ai/STANDARDS.md's example is written that way and NOTHING ELSE IN
#                        THESE FILES IS: every other lead-in in a MEMORY.md entry is bolded,
#                        so the house style is `- **Revisit:**` and the `**` sits exactly
#                        where the pattern demanded the word.
#                        MEASURED in ai-project-scaffold-dev: 10 triggers present, 10 bolded,
#                        0 matched. The check reported "no Revisit trigger" on 100% of
#                        entries since it shipped, including every entry that had one -- the
#                        single signal it exists to find was the one thing it could not see.
#                        AND `\b` WAS THE WRONG BOUNDARY. `_` is a word character, so
#                        `Revisit\b` fails on `_Revisit_:` -- the emphasis form breaking on
#                        its own closing mark. A negative lookahead for a letter is the
#                        property meant: the word Revisit, not Revisiting.
#   2026-09-01 v0.20.0.20260901.1656 — --session-head: THE LOAD ORDER STOPS ASKING FOR THE
#                        WHOLE LOG (#280). ai/SESSION.md is append-only and was read in full
#                        at every session start, so the older it got the more of every
#                        context window went to older and older history. MEASURED across
#                        four repositories on 2026-09-01, the nine always-loaded files came
#                        to 95, 156, 179 and 211 KB -- the last is roughly 54k tokens, a
#                        quarter of a window spent before the first instruction.
#                        ARCHIVING WAS NOT THE ANSWER ON ITS OWN. It moves entries out of a
#                        file people want whole in git; this moves nothing and deletes
#                        nothing. It prints the preamble plus the newest N entries (3 by
#                        default) and says how many it did not show. --bytes gives
#                        setup.sh --check the number the load order actually costs, so the
#                        ceiling measures what a session pays rather than what is on disk.
#   2026-09-01 v0.19.0.20260901.0615 — A SELFTEST THAT FAILED ON THE CONTENTS OF SOMEBODY'S
#                        MEMORY FILE. 0.17.0 asserted "ai/MEMORY.md is archivable, or teaches
#                        the archivable shape" inside selftest(). It is a true and useful
#                        property -- and it is a fact about a REPOSITORY, not about this
#                        tool. Every adopter whose ai/MEMORY.md predates the 0.17.0 template
#                        has zero dated entries and no placeholder, and ai/MEMORY.md is on
#                        the upgrade's never-touched list, so the new template reaches NEW
#                        adoptions only. Measured: it went red in control and localcoder-dev
#                        the moment they took 0.82.10. Preflight red on arrival is the one
#                        hazard this project keeps naming, because a gate that is red on
#                        arrival is a gate people learn to skip.
#                        A selftest asserts the TOOL. The repository condition moved to
#                        report_memory_archivability(), printed by --all --check as a [note ]
#                        that fails nothing -- and it is upstream of check_memory_format(),
#                        which reports on entries it RECOGNISES and therefore had nothing to
#                        say about the one file it could not read at all. The three cases now
#                        run on fixtures, one per shape.
#   2026-09-01 v0.18.0.20260901.0550 — ROTATING A SESSION LOG TURNED A GREEN REPO RED, and
#                        0.82.8 had just made the gate that recommends rotating a FAILING
#                        one. Session entries quote the commands that were run; once rotated
#                        they sit in SESSION_ARCHIVE.md naming tools since renamed or
#                        retired, and stale_path_scan reads them as live instructions.
#                        Measured here: one rotation moved 11 entries and produced three
#                        findings, turning a passing repo red as the direct result of running
#                        the archiver the gate had recommended. The mechanism already existed
#                        -- `scaffold:file-is-historical` is that scanner's own whole-file
#                        exemption, documented for files that "record dead commands" -- and
#                        nothing wrote it. Now stamped with a date and a reason, because the
#                        same scanner separately reports exemptions carrying neither.
#                        AND THE 0.17.0 TEMPLATE CASE OVER-GENERALISED. It asserted a property
#                        of the SHIPPED TEMPLATE and then ran in every adopter, where
#                        ai/MEMORY.md is a real memory file -- so it failed in
#                        ai-project-scaffold-dev, whose file has 78 dated entries and no
#                        placeholder. Identical mistake to adoption_check's new-project
#                        scenario, made the same day, both by assuming $ROOT is upstream. The
#                        property that holds everywhere is "this file is archivable, or it
#                        teaches the archivable shape".
#   2026-09-01 v0.17.0.20260901.0531 — IT COULD NOT SEE THE FILE IT SHIPS. memory_entries()
#                        recognises `## YYYY-MM-DD` headings. The shipped ai/MEMORY.md
#                        template contains none and never did: decisions were rows in a
#                        MARKDOWN TABLE and gotchas are list items. So for every adopter
#                        following the template exactly, `entries` was empty, and
#                        memory_preserve() printed "every non-stub entry is already preserved
#                        in ai/MEMORY_ARCHIVE.md" -- about a file that in most repos DOES NOT
#                        EXIST, over an empty set. Counted 2026-09-01: 78 dated entries in
#                        ai-project-scaffold-dev, 0 in localcoder, 0 in control, 0 here. It
#                        worked in the maintainer's own repo and was blind everywhere it
#                        shipped. An adopter hit it at 873 lines: over the line, told to
#                        archive, and told archiving was already done.
#                        THE TEMPLATE NOW TEACHES `### YYYY-MM-DD` ENTRIES and the parser
#                        accepts `##` or `###`. The selftest asserts the AGREEMENT -- that
#                        the shape the template teaches is the shape the parser accepts --
#                        because every existing case built its own dated fixture, which is
#                        how a suite of 30 checks missed that the shipped format matched
#                        none of them.
#                        AND `LINES` IS THE WRONG UNIT. These files are loaded at every
#                        session start, so the cost is tokens: localcoder's MEMORY.md is 236
#                        lines and 33,017 chars (~8,250 tok) where the -dev one is 736 lines
#                        and 50,489 (~12,600) -- 140 chars/line against 69. Under an 800-LINE
#                        ceiling the dense file may reach ~28,000 tokens while every report
#                        says it is comfortably under. CHAR_LIMITS adds that dimension,
#                        ADVISORY AND WITH NO BURST: a new measure able to fail a build the
#                        day it ships would redden repositories on a number nobody has been
#                        shown.
#                        THE DENOMINATOR IS COUNTED NOW, NOT DECLARED. `total = 8` had not
#                        moved in twenty additions: the suite said 31/31 whether it held 31
#                        checks or 66, so adding a case could only ever make the number go
#                        DOWN. It holds 66.
#   2026-08-20 — STAMP CORRECTED from .1330 to .0518. The first was
#                        FABRICATED: written from nothing rather than read from the clock,
#                        landing ~8 hours in the future. ai/STANDARDS.md names this exact
#                        failure -- a stamp rounded forward makes the next honest release
#                        sort EARLIER than its predecessor. The replacement is this file's
#                        real commit time from git.
#   2026-08-20 v0.16.0 — THE SHIPPED CEILING MOVES 600/700 -> 800/900. Asked for by the
#                        owner to make room for every participant writing to the record,
#                        not only Claude Code: a local model driven directly, or through
#                        localcoder, should land its outcome in ai/ too, and the old line
#                        was sized for one writer.
#                        FIVE SITES CARRY THE DEFAULT AND THREE MORE ONLY LOOK LIKE IT.
#                        This file's own header records the bug where a declaration and a
#                        doc drifted apart, so the split matters: DEFAULT_LIMITS,
#                        DEFAULT_BURSTS, the shipped-burst case, and both halves of the
#                        #210 drift case read the default and moved. The 600/700 inside
#                        `scaffold:ceilings` MARKERS did NOT -- those are fixture values
#                        proving the parser reads a declared pair, and rewriting them
#                        would have tested nothing while looking tidy.
#   2026-08-18 v0.11.0.20260818.0753 — --exit-status, because setup.sh had to GREP THIS TOOL'S
#                        PROSE to learn what happened, and grepped for `[over]` -- which does
#                        not match `[BURST]`. The worse state matched nothing and fell through
#                        to `[OK] ai/ files under their archive lines`.
#                        MEASURED IN THIS PROGRAMME'S OWN CONTEXT REPO: BACKLOG.md 23 lines
#                        over the archive line was REPORTED, while SESSION.md 316 lines PAST
#                        burst and MEMORY.md 120 past burst were SILENT. The check got
#                        quieter as the breach got worse.
#                        0 clean / 1 over / 2 burst, OPT-IN: plain --check is documented as
#                        always exiting 0 and callers rely on it, so the contract is unchanged.
#                        The selftest asserts the three rungs are STRICTLY ORDERED rather than
#                        merely present -- a case asserting "burst warns" would have passed
#                        the whole time, since check_size always printed the line. The loss
#                        was one caller down, in what it did with it.
#   2026-08-13 v0.10.1 — A CEILING DECLARED FOR A FILE THAT IS NOT THERE NOW SAYS SO. The
#                        production loop iterates the DECLARED ceilings, and check_size
#                        returned at its first line when the file was absent — so a marker
#                        naming a missing file produced NO OUTPUT AT ALL. The report was one
#                        line shorter and nothing said which line or why. "Under its limit"
#                        and "not checked at all" are the two states this tool exists to
#                        separate, and they printed identically.
#                        Same argument as scaffold:product-dir failing on a missing directory
#                        rather than skipping: otherwise renaming the target retires a check
#                        and discovery just gets quieter. Advisory, like everything here.
#                        Found by the owner asking whether the scaffold needs to SHIP
#                        ai/BACKLOG.md. It already does — all three are tracked templates —
#                        and the real gap was what happens once an adopter removes one.
#   2026-08-13 v0.10.0 — #180 STOPPED IT RECURRING AND NEVER TOLD THE PROJECTS ALREADY
#                        HOLDING IT (#210). Two live ceilings markers meant adopters ran whole
#                        releases on their own 150/200/260 because their line sat above
#                        upstream's. Making upstream's an inline example prevented NEW
#                        occurrences and did nothing for the existing ones, which had no way
#                        to find out. Reported from Robiton/godsfall, whose ai/STANDARDS.md
#                        DECLARES BACKLOG.md=200 at line 440 and DOCUMENTS 600/700 at line
#                        485 — the machine reads one, the human reads the other, forty-five
#                        lines apart, in the file loaded into every session.
#                        An over-the-line report now names both numbers. FIRES ONLY WHEN
#                        ACTIONABLE: a project deliberately holding a low ceiling is making a
#                        legitimate choice and is not nagged for it, and at or above the
#                        shipped default the note is silent — a warning that always fires is
#                        one people filter out, which is this file's founding argument.
#                        Also fixed a fixture that could not fail: the BACKLOG case asserted
#                        `is False` against a file that did not exist in the temp root, which
#                        check_size satisfies by returning at its first line.
#   2026-08-09 v0.9.0 — TWO LIVE ceilings MARKERS IS A REAL STATE, AND IT WAS SILENT (#180).
#                        Upstream carried its own marker at column 0 as an example; the
#                        three-way merge brought it into projects that already had one, and
#                        .search() takes the FIRST. An adopter ran a release on 150/200/260
#                        purely because their line sat above upstream's — any edit that
#                        reordered them would have moved the project to 600/700 with nothing
#                        reporting it. Upstream's example is inline code now (the values were
#                        the built-in defaults anyway, so nothing changes by not declaring
#                        them), and duplicates print every marker with the one in force.
#                        The rule is unchanged — FIRST wins — and is now stated and tested
#                        rather than emergent. The new case fails under last-wins.
#   2026-08-09 v0.8.0 — ALL THREE files ship 600/700, not just MEMORY.md. A burst on one
#                        file read as a special case rather than as how ceilings work
#                        here; one pair to remember, and no file where crossing the line
#                        means something different.
#                        The numbers are generous because of what the archive paths DO.
#                        SESSION.md MOVES text, automatically and losslessly — nothing is
#                        at risk there whatever the number says. BACKLOG.md and MEMORY.md
#                        COPY, and a human then deletes or trims: that is where a tight
#                        ceiling becomes pressure on a person to remove something, and no
#                        number here should be pushing anyone toward that.
#   2026-08-09 v0.7.0 — MEMORY.md ships at 600 with a BURST line at 700, and neither
#                        number blocks. That is what separates this from the warn/hard
#                        pair 0.14.0 removed: a hard level failed the build and caught
#                        people mid-thought; a burst line changes the VOLUME of a report
#                        and never its exit code. It exists because one number cannot say
#                        both "you crossed the line while writing decisions" and "the trim
#                        stopped happening", and a report that says the same thing at 601
#                        lines and at 750 is one people stop reading.
#                        `NAME=600/700` reuses the 0.13.x warn/hard syntax deliberately:
#                        reinterpreting it is a strict SOFTENING, since the larger number
#                        used to fail the build and now only raises volume, and the lower
#                        number keeps the meaning it always had.
#                        Also: three marker fixtures hardcoded 400 as "over the built-in
#                        ceiling", true at 350 and false at 600 — they went green while
#                        asserting the opposite of what they read. Derived from
#                        DEFAULT_LIMITS now. A fixture that encodes a constant it does not
#                        own is a second definition of that constant.
#   2026-08-08 v0.6.1 — The MEMORY.md fallback ceiling is 350, matching what the scaffold
#                        now declares. It is only a fallback — ai/STANDARDS.md is the
#                        definition — but a fallback that disagrees with the shipped
#                        marker reports a different verdict the moment the marker is
#                        missing, which is the one situation where nobody is looking.
#   2026-08-08 v0.6.0 — ARCHIVING IS ADVISORY. Nothing in this tool fails a build any more.
#                        The hard level went in as "warn gives room, hard still bites", and
#                        the bite was the wrong instrument: these files are a working
#                        record, and failing CI over their length stops the work to tidy
#                        the notes about the work. Every hard variant caught someone
#                        mid-thought. One number per file now — the line at which you
#                        should archive; 0.13.x warn/hard markers still load, on the lower
#                        number. --check and --all --check both exit 0, so the two modes
#                        can no longer disagree at all (#142's defect is gone by
#                        construction rather than by a matching exemption).
#                        BACKLOG.md gains the third can_shrink supplier it never had, so
#                        every file's advice distinguishes "there is something to archive"
#                        from "this is simply long" — the latter says to shorten or raise
#                        the number instead, because advice that cannot be followed is how
#                        a report stops being read.
#   2026-08-08 v0.5.1 — --all --check honours the same "nothing left to archive" exemption
#                        the single-file path has always applied (#142). They returned
#                        OPPOSITE verdicts for one ai/SESSION.md — 89 lines, one entry,
#                        --check passed and --all --check failed — and --all is the mode a
#                        project wires into CI, so the decision that failing on one long
#                        entry "would be noise" was made in the path CI does not use and
#                        silently reversed in the path it does. check_size's conditional is
#                        now general: `can_shrink` is whatever archiving could still remove,
#                        non-stub entries for MEMORY.md and rotatable entries for SESSION.md.
#   2026-08-08 v0.5.0 — Check the MEMORY entry FORMAT, and preserve before anyone trims.
#                        The ceiling was enforced and the format was not, so a line count
#                        could not tell "the ceiling is too low" from "nobody wrote stubs"
#                        — the ambiguity ai/STANDARDS.md warns about, which then moved that
#                        repo's ceiling 250 -> 300 -> 350 in three weeks. Measured on it:
#                        23 dated entries = 286 of 348 lines, 82%, averaging 12 lines
#                        against a 3-4 line bar, 6 of 23 carrying an archive reference.
#                        ADVISORY, never blocking: making it fail would turn every existing
#                        MEMORY.md red on this release, which is #76 exactly.
#                        --memory-preserve copies non-stub entries VERBATIM into
#                        MEMORY_ARCHIVE.md and never writes MEMORY.md. Archive, not purge:
#                        choosing which lines are the decision is judgement and a script
#                        guessing would drop a live one, but COPYING is not a judgement, so
#                        the human's trim becomes reversible by construction. Idempotent.
#                        Five selftest cases including the safety property itself.
#                        TWO LEVELS, HARD ONE CONDITIONAL. `MEMORY.md=250/350` is warn/hard;
#                        a bare number still means both, so existing markers are unchanged.
#                        A single hard line fires on the commit that crosses it — in
#                        practice the middle of writing an entry — and ai/SECURITY.md's own
#                        rule is that a guard blocking legitimate work gets disabled. Warn
#                        gives room to finish; hard still bites, because a level that never
#                        bites is what let SESSION.md reach 1,001 lines against a stated 150.
#                        The hard level blocks ONLY while entries are still essays: all
#                        stubs and still over means archiving cannot help and the number is
#                        too small, so it warns and says to raise it. That is the ambiguity
#                        ai/STANDARDS.md names, made machine-answerable — and it is what
#                        stops the ceiling being the thing that moves every few weeks.
#                        ALL THREE FILES flex, not just MEMORY.md — a long session entry or
#                        a busy backlog crosses its line mid-work the same way. And
#                        --backlog-preserve gives BACKLOG.md the same copy-only archive path
#                        MEMORY.md has. SESSION.md stays the one command that MOVES text, and
#                        its selftest now asserts the move is lossless; the other two only
#                        ever add, so "this tool never removes anything" holds toolchain-wide
#                        rather than per command.
#   2026-08-05 v0.4.1 — Anchor the ceilings marker to column 0, so a documented example
#                        cannot be read as a declaration. Correct today only because no
#                        second example existed yet.
#   2026-08-04 v0.4.0 — Ceilings are read from the `<!-- scaffold:ceilings ... -->` line in
#                        ai/STANDARDS.md, not hardcoded here. `tools/` is VENDORED — a
#                        project that raised its ceiling in this file would have it
#                        silently reverted by the next scaffold update, and the reversion
#                        would look like the file suddenly going over. ai/STANDARDS.md is
#                        marked never-overwrite and already states the ceilings in prose,
#                        so the machine-readable copy now sits beside the human-readable
#                        one: one definition, editable safely. `--check` names which source
#                        it used. Added `--selftest` (6 cases) proving the marker changes
#                        the verdict in BOTH directions — a config mechanism only ever
#                        exercised at its default is indistinguishable from a constant.
#   2026-08-04 v0.3.0 — `--all --apply` accepted the flag and rotated nothing. Refuse it
#                        and name the command that does rotate. Added the file header this
#                        file was missing entirely — it is the tool that enforces the
#                        scaffold's own rules, and it did not follow them.
#   2026-08-04 v0.2.0 — `--all`: check every ai/ file with a stated ceiling, not just
#                        SESSION.md; preserve an existing archive's own preamble; never
#                        count or rotate the template blocks a fresh scaffold ships with.
#   2026-07-31 v0.1.0 — Initial creation
"""session_archive — rotate the append-only scaffold logs past their stated ceilings.

WHY THIS EXISTS
  ai/STANDARDS.md already specifies the ceilings:
    SESSION.md  — exceeds its archive line -> SESSION_ARCHIVE.md (a lossless MOVE)
    BACKLOG.md  — at each release, completed tasks -> BACKLOG_ARCHIVE.md
    MEMORY.md   — superseded entries               -> MEMORY_ARCHIVE.md
  Nobody does it. Measured 2026-07-31 in this repo: SESSION.md was 1001 lines
  against its own ~150-line ceiling, and no archive file existed at all. A rule
  that depends on a human remembering it at the end of a long session is a rule
  that quietly stops being true, and these files are loaded at EVERY session
  start — so the cost of ignoring it is paid by every future session.

  This makes it mechanical. Run it from a hook, from CI, or by hand.

CEILINGS ARE DECLARED IN ai/STANDARDS.md, not here — see load_limits() for why.

Usage:
  tools/session_archive.py --check     # report only, non-zero if over ceiling (for CI)
  tools/session_archive.py --all       # every file with a stated ceiling
  tools/session_archive.py --apply     # actually rotate SESSION.md
  tools/session_archive.py --keep 5    # sessions to retain (default 5)
  tools/session_archive.py --selftest  # prove the ceiling marker is load-bearing

# ai/STANDARDS.md states ceilings for THREE files; only SESSION.md was ever enforced.
# A stated ceiling that nothing enforces is the failure this project already learned the
# hard way — SESSION.md reached 1001 lines against a stated ~150 precisely because the
# rule depended on someone remembering it. MEMORY.md and BACKLOG.md were on exactly that
# footing: measured downstream, ai/MEMORY.md grew 148 -> 218 lines in a single day and
# nothing complained, because nothing was watching.
#
# The destination is NOT the hard part — the SELECTION is, and it differs per file:
#   SESSION.md  oldest entries, purely age-based        -> mechanical, --apply supported
#   BACKLOG.md  completed tasks, at each release        -> mechanical, --apply supported
#   MEMORY.md   SUPERSEDED decisions                    -> needs judgement, --check only
# Auto-rotating MEMORY.md would mean a script deciding which decisions are obsolete.
# That is a human call, so it is reported and never applied.
# ONE NUMBER PER FILE: the line at which you should ARCHIVE. Nothing here ever blocks.
#
# These files are a working record, and a check that fails the build over their length
# stops the work to tidy the notes about the work. Every hard variant of this tried so far
# hit someone mid-thought: a single hard line fires on the commit that crosses it, and
# ai/SECURITY.md's own rule is that a guard blocking legitimate work gets disabled — at
# which point it protects nothing anyway.
#
# So the enforcement is not a gate, it is the pair of properties that make archiving safe
# and obvious: the report says exactly which entries are over the bar and what archiving
# would recover, and every archive path ADDS to the archive without removing from the live
# file, so acting on it is never a risk. A warning you can act on in one command is a
# different thing from a warning with no cheap remedy.
#
# The known cost, recorded rather than hidden: ai/SESSION.md once reached 1,001 lines
# against a stated ~150 while this was advisory. That is why the report is specific and
# why --apply and the preserve commands exist. Length is a housekeeping matter; it is not
# worth a red build.
# MEMORY.md sits higher than the other two on purpose. A session entry is a log line and a
# backlog item is a task, but a memory entry is an argument — decision, what it rules out,
# the evidence that settled it — and the entries worth re-reading run 13 to 35 lines. At 250
# a project crossed the line for having eight of them, and the cheapest way back under was
# to write the next decision as a one-liner nobody can act on. See ai/STANDARDS.md.
# ALL THREE FILES FLEX, AND THEY FLEX THE SAME WAY. Until 0.19.0 only MEMORY.md had a
# burst line, which made the mechanism look like a special case for one file rather than how
# ceilings work here. The numbers are deliberately identical: one pair to remember, and no
# file where crossing the line means something different from the others.
# THE SIZE CEILING, IN THE UNIT THAT IS ACTUALLY PAID. See check_size() for the measurement
# that motivated it. ~48,000 chars is about 12,000 tokens, which is what 800 lines costs at
# the ~60 chars/line these templates were sized against. No burst pair: this reports and
# never fails, until there is fleet data to justify promoting it.

# ==== THE REVISIT DETECTOR MATCHED A FORM NOBODY WRITES (#284) =============================

# ai/STANDARDS.md's own example is written that way, and NOTHING ELSE IN THESE FILES IS. Every
# other lead-in in a MEMORY.md entry is bolded, so the form people actually write is
# `- **Revisit:** ...`, and the `**` sits exactly where the pattern demanded the word.
#
# MEASURED 2026-09-02 in ai-project-scaffold-dev: 10 Revisit triggers present, 10 in the bold
# form, 0 matched. The check has reported "no Revisit trigger" on 100% of entries since it
# shipped, including every entry that had one — so the one signal it exists to find was the one
# thing it could never see, and the report was uniformly, confidently wrong.
#
# THE FIX IS TO READ THE FILE'S HOUSE STYLE, not to make people write against it. Optional
# emphasis (`**`, `*`, `_`, `__`) and an optional heading form are accepted; the word and its
# position in the bullet still carry the meaning.
# `\b` IS THE WRONG BOUNDARY HERE. `_` is a word character, so `Revisit\b` does not match
# `_Revisit_:` — the emphasis form fails on its own closing mark. A negative lookahead for a
# letter is the property meant: "the word Revisit, not Revisiting".

    #     localcoder              ai/MEMORY.md   236 lines   33,017 chars   ~8,250 tok
    #     ai-project-scaffold-dev ai/MEMORY.md   736 lines   50,489 chars  ~12,600 tok
    #
    # 236 lines costs two thirds of what 736 lines costs -- 140 chars/line against 69. Under
    # an 800-line ceiling, localcoder's file may grow to roughly 28,000 tokens and every

    # the obvious response to "we keep hitting it", makes a wrong measure wronger.

    #
    # #180 was two live `scaffold:ceilings` markers: upstream's example sat at column 0, the
    # three-way merge carried it into projects that had their own, and `.search()` took the
    # first. Adopters ran whole releases on their own numbers purely because of line order.
    # The fix made upstream's example inline code, so a NEW occurrence is impossible.
    #
    # It did nothing for the projects already sitting on the old numbers, and there was no
    # way for them to find out. Reported from `Robiton/godsfall` on 2026-08-13 (#210), where
    # `ai/STANDARDS.md` DECLARES `BACKLOG.md=200` at line 440 and DOCUMENTS `600/700` at line
    # 485 — the machine reads one, the human reads the other, and they are 45 lines apart in
    # the file loaded into every session.
    #
    # FIRES ONLY WHEN IT IS ACTIONABLE. A project deliberately holding a low ceiling is making
    # a legitimate choice and must not be nagged for it — a warning that always fires is one
    # people filter out, which is this file's own founding argument. So it speaks only when
    # the file is ALREADY over, where the reader is being asked to do work and the stale
