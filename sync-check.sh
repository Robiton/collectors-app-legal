# Version:  0.20.0.20260820.0537
# Purpose:  Pre-work check that this clone's ai/ context is current with the remote.
# Changelog:
#   2026-08-20 — STAMP CORRECTED from .1345 to .0537. The first was
#                        FABRICATED: written from nothing rather than read from the clock,
#                        landing ~8 hours in the future. ai/STANDARDS.md names this exact
#                        failure -- a stamp rounded forward makes the next honest release
#                        sort EARLIER than its predecessor. The replacement is this file's
#                        real commit time from git.
#   2026-08-20 v0.20.0 — THE SECOND DEFINITION OF THE CEILING IS GONE, THIRD TIME LUCKY.
#                        v0.7.0 found this fallback hardcoding 150 against a shipped 600,
#                        named it 'a second definition of a ceiling', and fixed it by
#                        hardcoding 600 -- still a second definition, which merely agreed
#                        for a year. The shipped default moved to 800/900 today and this
#                        line said 600 again, in the script that runs at EVERY session
#                        start. It no longer carries a number at all: with the archiver
#                        vendored we never reach this branch, and without it the ceiling
#                        is genuinely unknowable here -- it lives in a scaffold:ceilings
#                        marker and parsing that is the tool's job. Reports the COUNT and
#                        says there is no ceiling to compare it against.
#   2026-08-11 v0.9.0 — WARN THE ADOPTERS THE UPGRADE FIX CANNOT REACH. scaffold_upgrade.sh
#                        before 0.16.0 expands an empty array at the line that PERFORMS the
#                        handover, so on bash 3.2 — every Mac — a bare run aborts in the
#                        OUTGOING copy before control reaches the fixed one. No release can
#                        unstick them: reaching the new code is what is broken. And
#                        --dry-run PASSES, because one argument makes the array non-empty,
#                        so the only run that writes is the only one that fails.
#                        This prints the one-time escape (`--to <tag>`), which installs the
#                        fixed copy and makes bare runs work permanently after.
#                        PLACED ABOVE EVERY EARLY EXIT, not appended: this script exits 0
#                        when there is no remote branch, and the first draft of this check
#                        sat below that line where a stuck adopter would never see it.
#                        MAJOR.MINOR compared NUMERICALLY — "0.9" sorts above "0.16" as a
#                        string, a comparison bug this project has already paid for twice.
#   2026-08-09 v0.8.0 — Logs its own run and REPORTS what has gone quiet. The two halves
#                        only work together: a run log nobody reads is a file, and a
#                        session-start check is the one thing guaranteed to read it. It
#                        prints the finding only, never the inventory — a full table every
#                        session start is the noise that gets a report ignored.
#                        This script is why the log exists: it had never fired once on the
#                        machine that develops this scaffold.
#   2026-08-09 v0.7.0 — The inline SESSION.md fallback hardcoded 150 while the shipped
#                        marker said 600 — a second definition of a ceiling, in the one
#                        path that runs when the tool that owns it is absent. It now uses
#                        the shipped default and SAYS it could not read the project's own
#                        marker, rather than reporting a number as though it had.
#   2026-08-09 v0.6.0 — Reports red CI on the remote (tools/ci_status.sh), and FIXES a
#                        nudge that had been dead since 0.14.0: the archive check
#                        branched on an exit code that command stopped returning when
#                        it became advisory, so the session-start reminder could not
#                        fire at all for five releases. A check that has gone silent
#                        looks exactly like a check with nothing to report.
#   2026-08-04 v0.5.0 — Added the file header this script had never carried. It shipped
#                        headerless from the beginning in the repo that publishes the
#                        header rule, and nothing noticed for four releases because
#                        nothing checked — see tools/header_check.sh, which now does.
#                        Version set to 0.5.0 to match the release it ships in rather
#                        than inventing a history it does not have.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------- the stuck-upgrader trap
#
# THE ONE FIX THAT CANNOT DELIVER ITSELF. `tools/scaffold_upgrade.sh` before 0.16.0 expands
# an empty array as "${_ORIG_ARGS[@]}" at the line that PERFORMS the handover. Under bash
# 3.2 — still the system bash on every Mac — an empty array under `set -u` is "unbound" and
# aborts. So a bare `tools/scaffold_upgrade.sh` dies in the OUTGOING copy, before control
# ever reaches the fixed one, and no future release can unstick it: reaching the new code is
# exactly what is broken.
#
# AND THE SIGNAL SHAPE IS THE WORST POSSIBLE. `--dry-run` is one argument, so the array is
# non-empty and the dry run passes CLEANLY. The bare run — the only one that writes — is the
# only one that fails.
#
# The escape is one argument. `--to <tag>` makes the array non-empty, the upgrade completes,
# and the copy it installs carries the fix, so bare works permanently afterwards. Reported
# from a real macOS adoption at 0.34.0 that hit this and had no way to be told.

# ------------------------------------------------------------------ remote CI
#
# LOCAL GREEN IS NOT CI GREEN, AND THIS PROJECT LEARNED THAT THE EXPENSIVE WAY.
# Measured 2026-08-08: the dev context repo was red for four hours while every local check
# passed, because the failing step lints by a header the local run never exercised — and it
# was the OWNER who noticed, not the toolchain. The lesson went into ai/MEMORY.md and then
# stayed a note, which is the failure this repo names most often: a rule with no checker
# behind it is not a rule.
#
# AN EXIT TRAP, NOT A LINE AT THE BOTTOM, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT.
# This script exits early on four paths — it is the scaffold's own repo, there is no
# remote branch, ai/ is behind, not a git repo — and three of them are the states where
# you MOST want to know whether the remote is red. Written as a final statement it ran on
# exactly one path: the one where everything was already fine. That is the same shape as
# the archive nudge below, which branched on an exit code the tool stopped returning and
# went silent for five releases. A check placed where it cannot run is not a check.
#
# The trap does not change the exit status: bash preserves it across an EXIT handler that
# does not itself exit.
#
# Silent when it cannot ask — no gh, no auth, no GitHub remote, offline. See
# tools/ci_status.sh for why that is not a compromise: a check that errors on a plane is
# one people disable, and then none of the checks above run either.

# make is the one nothing else in this toolchain can: `setup.sh --check` reports on the
# checks it RUNS, which by construction cannot include a check that no longer runs at all.
#
# This exists because four hooks — including this script's own — had never fired on the
# machine that develops this scaffold, and there was no artefact anywhere that could have
# shown it. Silence is what a passing check and an absent check both look like.
