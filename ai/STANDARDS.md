# Project Standards — Master Reference

## Load order

On project start, read these files in this order:
1. `ai/MEMORY.md`   — prior decisions, architecture, known gotchas
2. `ai/BACKLOG.md`  — current tasks and status (this is the to-do list)
3. `ai/SESSION.md`  — **the newest 3 entries only**, not the whole file:
   `tools/session_archive.py --session-head`. It is an append-only log, so reading
   all of it means paying more of every context window for older and older history.
   The rest stays in the file; ask for it by date when you need it.
4. `ai/CODING.md`   — coding style and patterns for this project
5. `ai/SECURITY.md` — security requirements (always apply, no exceptions)
6. `ai/PLANNING.md` — how to structure plans and spec documents
7. `ai/TEAM.md`     — team roster, ownership, working agreements

If this file contains an overlay section below the separator line (`---`),
that content is project-type specific and applies to this project in addition
to the base standards above. Read it as part of the same load sequence.

Project-type overlays live in `overlays/` (splunk-app, python-script, api-integration,
it-automation, security-tool, ai-skill). They are applied to a project via `setup.sh`.

**Two files are deliberately NOT in that list, and both ship with the scaffold:**

- `ai/OPERATIONS.md` — the reference half of the standards: cutting a release, stamping a
  header, reading a CI result, setting an archive ceiling. Every rule in it is enforced by a
  tool, which is why it is safe to read on demand. Open it when you are doing one of those
  things.
- `ai/STANDARDS_EVIDENCE.md` — what each rule cost to learn. Open it when you want to
  *change* a rule.

**Claude Code's auto memory is not this, and does not replace it.** Claude writes notes to
itself under `<config>/projects/<encoded-workspace>/memory/`. Those are **per machine and not
committed** — the exact gap `ai/MEMORY.md` exists to close — so they are a *source*, never the
record. `tools/close_out.py --distill` lists them at closeout as candidates, marked by origin,
and promotes none of them: the same rule correction candidates follow, for the same reason.
A fact promoted without a person's judgement is a rule nobody agreed to.

`ai/REFERENCE.md` contains project-type-specific examples, templates, and
reference material. Load it on demand when you need detailed examples for
a specific task — do not load it at every session start.

## Rule precedence — additive only

Rules layer from most general to most specific. A more-specific layer may **add**
rules or make an existing rule **stricter** — it may never **loosen** a more
general one. This keeps the model predictable: a project can be more conservative
than the baseline, never less.

Specificity ladder (general → specific):
1. `ai/SECURITY.md` hard lines — **immutable**; no layer below may relax them, ever
2. Base `ai/` standards — the org-wide baseline (the floor)
3. Project-type overlay (the section below the `---`, plus overlay files) — adds/tightens for the project type
4. This project's own edits to its `ai/` files — most specific
5. A tool's local memory — lowest; see "Source of truth" below

Conflict resolution:
- **Immutability** — `ai/SECURITY.md` hard lines win over everything, always.
- **The ratchet** — if a more-specific rule would *loosen* a more-general rule, the more-general rule wins. A more-specific layer may only add or tighten.
- **Specialization** — where layers differ *without* loosening (e.g., a project selects a test framework, or a stricter naming scheme), the most-specific layer wins.

In one line: *security is absolute; otherwise the most-specific rule wins, but specificity can only tighten, never loosen.*

## Where a new rule goes — base vs overlay

| If the rule is about… | Put it in… |
| --- | --- |
| Security, approved libraries/frameworks, org-wide coding style, documentation standards | **Base `ai/` files** — every project inherits it |
| A project-type's test framework, API conventions, naming schemes, integration patterns | **That project-type's overlay** (`overlays/<type>/`) |

If unsure, default to the narrower scope (overlay): a rule can be promoted to base later if it proves universal, whereas an over-general rule forces itself on projects it doesn't fit.

## Nested AGENTS.md — multi-component repos

For repos holding many components (e.g. dozens of Splunk apps in one repo), one root
AGENTS.md cannot tell an agent which component's build to run or version to bump.
Major AI tools resolve the **nearest AGENTS.md** (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor et al.
read the file in the working directory, then parents up to the repo root).

- **Root AGENTS.md** — repo-wide: the `ai/STANDARDS.md` load order, versioning, hooks.
- **Component AGENTS.md** (`<component>/AGENTS.md`) — that component's **commands and
  facts only**: build/test/package commands, version file locations, deploy target,
  component-specific gotchas. Target ~5–15 lines.
- **Nearest wins, additively.** A nested file adds to or tightens the root — it never
  loosens it (same ratchet as rule precedence above). It must not restate standards
  that live in `ai/` files; standards have one home.
- Keep nested files current in the same PR that changes the component's commands —
  a stale command block is worse than none.

Worked example for a multi-app repo: `docs/ADOPTION_GUIDE.md` → *Nested AGENTS.md
for multi-component repos*.

## Session rules

- **Update `ai/SESSION.md` at milestones and at session end** — include your name and
  tool. Never only at the end: see *The session record* below
- When tasks change status, update `ai/BACKLOG.md`
- When architectural or design decisions are made, update `ai/MEMORY.md`
- When the human corrects the agent mid-session, **note the correction** — see
  *Corrections are learnings* below
- Never store secrets, credentials, API keys, or sensitive data in any `ai/` file
- If unsure where something belongs, ask before writing

### The session record
The conversation is disposable; the `ai/` files are the record. Every AI tool has a context
limit, long sessions get compacted, and a session can die outright — context that exists
only in the conversation does not survive any of that. `ai/SESSION.md` written *only* at the
end means a session that dies first loses **everything**. Not hypothetical: the project this
rule came from ran sessions long enough that `SESSION.md` was written once, hours in, from
memory.

**Two stages, and getting the split wrong produces either noise or nothing:**

| | what it is | who writes it, and when |
|---|---|---|
| **Facts** | what changed, what was committed, when, on which branch | a hook, continuously — mechanical, and exactly what is lost when a session dies |
| **Narrative** | why, what was decided, what to do next | **the agent**, at each milestone and at session end — needs judgment, and a hook that tried would generate noise nobody reads |

If the session dies, the facts survive and the narrative is reconstructable from them.

**When the agent writes:**
- At **natural milestones** — each merged PR, each completed task — not only at session end
- **Before any context compaction or summarization** the tool announces or you trigger:
  flush unrecorded decisions, progress and gotchas to the `ai/` files first
- Decisions never wait: `ai/MEMORY.md` is updated the moment a decision lands — that is
  what makes it compaction-proof

**The journal:**
- `tools/session_journal.sh` captures the facts into `ai/SESSION_JOURNAL.md`. It is
  **gitignored** — per-developer working state, not history. It stays silent when nothing
  changed.
- The journal is **not** the session log. Distil it into `ai/SESSION.md` and let it reset.
  An un-distilled journal at session start means a previous session ended without writing
  `SESSION.md` — the tool announces that, because it is the exact failure it exists to
  surface.
- **Tool-agnostic by design.** The *script* is portable; only the hook wiring is Claude
  Code-specific (`.claude/settings.json`). Other tools run it manually or wire their own
  trigger — the rule is the record, never the hook.

### Work that leaves no trace in git
Every other rule here assumes the unit of work is a **code change** — the planning phases,
the review gate, `scaffold-check`, the whole idea that the conversation is disposable
because the `ai/` files and git together hold the record.

**Git is doing more of that work than it looks.** A bad commit is diffable, reviewable and
revertible. Some sessions change no code at all and instead mutate live state: importing a
data export, correcting a mis-keyed record, pushing a config, changing a permission,
calling an infrastructure API. Those have **no diff, no PR and no revert** — so for them,
`ai/SESSION.md` is not the *secondary* record, it is the **only** one.

That inverts the usual risk. Ordinarily a thin session note costs future context; here it
costs the ability to undo.

**When a session mutates state that git does not track:**

1. **Snapshot first, and record where.** Take the snapshot before the first mutating call
   and put its path in `ai/SESSION.md`. A rollback should not need archaeology.
   `ai/SECURITY.md` carries the hard line: the snapshot must be **verified restorable**,
   not merely taken.
2. **State a reconciliation invariant up front, and check it before reporting done.**
   Something that must hold if the work succeeded — "sum of line items equals sum of
   expense rows" — and put the resulting number in the session record. That is what turns
   "done" from a hope into a fact.
3. **Record what was deliberately deferred, and why.** Partial work is normal here
   (missing data, an undelivered item, a record you could not reconcile). An unrecorded
   partial is indistinguishable from finished work a month later.

**Rules that assume a code change should say so.** If a project has a rule of the form
"every change gets an X" — a CHANGELOG entry, a version bump, a test — scope it explicitly
to code. Otherwise the honest answer for a data session is "this rule does not apply here",
which every agent and every person has to re-derive, and some will get wrong by writing
noise instead.

### Audit and roadmap documents carry status, not just severity
Any document that will outlive the session that produced it — an audit, a review, a
roadmap, a migration plan — needs a **per-item status column from the moment it is
written**, and a dated verification pass whenever it is used to plan work.

**A severity marker is not a status marker.** 🔴 tells a reader how much an item matters,
never whether it is still true. Measured: a commissioned audit labelled all 16 findings
with severity and no status. Three weeks later **14 of the 16 were fixed** — and every one
still read as outstanding, because severity was the only axis the document had. A plan
derived from it listed six items as pending; all six were done, plus one from the phase
after.

Nothing was broken. The **map** was wrong, which is worse in one specific way: it is
invisible. Broken code fails loudly; a stale roadmap quietly directs the next session to
redo finished work or "fix" what is already fixed.

The author cannot fix this retroactively — by the time drift is visible, the person who
knew what shipped has moved on. So the status column goes in **on day one**, not when
someone notices.

This composes with *Corrections are learnings* below: the verification pass is where a
stale document gets corrected rather than quietly obeyed.

### Corrections are learnings
Mid-session corrections — "no, use X not Y", a wrong name, a wrong approach — are
context that evaporates at session end unless captured. Decisions get MEMORY.md
entries; corrections usually don't rise to that level, so they need their own path:

1. **Capture** — when corrected, note the correction (a running list in the session
   is enough). A human-typed `remember:` prefix marks something as a learning
   explicitly — honor it in any tool.
   **`tools/correction_capture.py` does this half automatically**, on the same Stop
   hook as the journal: it appends the correction VERBATIM to `ai/SESSION_JOURNAL.md`
   and does nothing else — no classifying, no scoring, no writing to a context file.
   Steps 2 and 3 still need a person. The rules are deliberately narrow: run
   `tools/correction_capture.py --measure <transcript>` before widening one, and delete
   a rule whose matches are mostly not corrections rather than tuning it.
   Evidence: ai/STANDARDS_EVIDENCE.md -> correction capture is deliberately narrow.
2. **Review** — at session END, replay the list with the human: is this recurring/
   behavioral, or a one-off?
3. **Apply** — recurring corrections go to `ai/MEMORY.md` (or the standard they
   contradict); one-offs die with the session. **When one lands, record which rule found
   it** — `tools/correction_capture.py --promote <rule>`, where the rule name is the tag in
   the journal line. That is the only acceptance signal the capture tool ever gets, and
   `--health` turns it into promoted/captured per rule. If a correction lands while a
   project skill is executing, route it to the skill file too (see the ai-skill overlay).

Never auto-write corrections to context files without the review step — the human
approves each learning before it becomes permanent (same bar as MEMORY.md entries
below). `AGENTS.md` is never auto-written: it stays human-curated — propose the
edit; the human applies it.

### Archiving — keep session-start files small, keep history forever
The `ai/` files loaded at every session start must stay small; history moves to
sibling `*_ARCHIVE.md` files. Archives are ordinary committed files — full history
stays on GitHub and remains searchable by any tool or person — but they are **never
loaded at session start**; read them on demand only, when older context is needed.

| File | When to archive | Where |
|------|----------------|-------|
| `ai/SESSION.md` | Exceeds its archive line (800) — move oldest entries | `ai/SESSION_ARCHIVE.md` |
| `ai/BACKLOG.md` | At each release — move completed tasks | `ai/BACKLOG_ARCHIVE.md` |
| `ai/MEMORY.md` | **Always** — a live decision keeps a stub here (decision + evidence + revisit trigger) and its rationale in the archive. A *superseded* decision leaves entirely, with `superseded by <entry/date>` | `ai/MEMORY_ARCHIVE.md` |

Create an archive file the first time it is needed. Archive entries keep their
original dates and are append-only — newest at the top, never rewritten.

**Archiving is a session-start duty.** If a file is over its threshold when you begin
work, archive before starting anything else — do not let it keep growing.

**And it is reported, not trusted — and it does NOT block.** A rule that depends on
memory is a rule that decays, so `tools/session_currency.sh --check` asks git rather
than asking you. It warns and never fails the build: a gate that stops the work to tidy
the notes about the work is one people route around.
Evidence: ai/STANDARDS_EVIDENCE.md -> the session record gate warns and does not block.

```bash
tools/session_archive.py --check    # report only; non-zero if over ceiling (CI runs this)
tools/session_archive.py --apply    # rotate the oldest entries into SESSION_ARCHIVE.md
tools/session_archive.py --all --check          # all three files, plus the MEMORY format report
tools/session_archive.py --memory-preserve      # full text -> MEMORY_ARCHIVE.md (dry run)
tools/session_archive.py --memory-preserve --apply
tools/session_archive.py --backlog-preserve     # completed items -> BACKLOG_ARCHIVE.md
tools/session_archive.py --backlog-preserve --apply
```

**Every ceiling flexes, and every path archives rather than deletes.** One number per
file, and crossing it is a report, never a refusal. None of the three has a hard level.

| file | archive at | burst | how it archives |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `SESSION.md` | 800 | 900 | `--apply` **moves** oldest entries to `SESSION_ARCHIVE.md` |
| `BACKLOG.md` | 800 | 900 | `--backlog-preserve --apply` **copies** completed items; you delete |
| `MEMORY.md` | 800 | 900 | `--memory-preserve --apply` **copies** full entries; you trim |

**The third column is what decides how much the number matters.** `SESSION.md` is the
only path that MOVES text, automatically and losslessly. `BACKLOG.md` and `MEMORY.md`
**copy, and a human deletes or trims** — which is where a tight ceiling turns into pressure
on a person to remove something, and why these numbers are generous. The archive is the
safety net; no number should push anyone toward the alternative.
Evidence: ai/STANDARDS_EVIDENCE.md -> the third column decides how much the ceiling matters.

**The ceiling was enforced and the FORMAT was not, which is why the ceiling kept
moving.** A line count cannot tell *"the ceiling is too low"* from *"nobody wrote
stubs"*. Raising it is almost never the fix; stubbing the entries is.
Evidence: ai/STANDARDS_EVIDENCE.md -> the ceiling moved because the format was not enforced.

`--all --check` now reports which entries are not stubs and what stubbing would recover.
It is **advisory and never fails the build** — making it blocking would turn every existing
`ai/MEMORY.md` red on the release that introduced it, which is the #76 defect this project
already paid for once.

**THESE NUMBERS ARE ADVISORY. Nothing here fails a build.** `MEMORY.md=250/350` from
0.13.x still loads, on the lower number.

A check that fails the build over the length of these files stops the work in order to tidy
the notes about the work, and every hard variant tried here caught someone mid-thought — a
single line fires on the commit that crosses it, and `ai/SECURITY.md`'s own rule is that a
guard blocking legitimate work gets disabled, at which point it protects nothing.

So the enforcement is not a gate. It is two properties that make archiving obvious and safe:
the report names exactly which entries are over the bar and what archiving would recover,
and **every archive path adds to the archive without removing from the live file**. A
warning you can act on in one command is a different thing from a warning with no remedy.

The known cost, recorded rather than hidden: `ai/SESSION.md` once reached 1,001 lines
against a stated ~150 while this was advisory. That is why the report is specific, and why
`--apply` and the preserve commands exist. Length is housekeeping; it is not worth a red
build.

**ARCHIVE FIRST, THEN TRIM — nothing is ever deleted.** `--memory-preserve` copies each
non-stub entry *verbatim* into `ai/MEMORY_ARCHIVE.md` and **never modifies `ai/MEMORY.md`**.
That split is the whole safety argument: deciding which lines are the decision and which are
the rationale is judgement, and a script guessing would drop a live one — but *copying* is
not a judgement, and once the full text is in the archive the human's trim is reversible by
construction. It is idempotent, so re-running never duplicates. Deciding a decision is
**superseded** remains a human call and is never automated.

### Exit 3 means "I verified nothing", and it is not a pass

**A gate that could not run and a gate that ran clean must not exit the same code.** Every
caller — `tools/preflight.sh`, CI, a person reading green — acts on the exit code, so a tool
that cannot check and returns 0 reports *verified* when the truth is *examined nothing*.

| code | meaning |
|---:|---|
| `0` | checked, clean |
| `1` | checked, found problems |
| `2` | usage error |
| **`3`** | **SKIPPED — a precondition was absent. Verified NOTHING.** |

Evidence: ai/STANDARDS_EVIDENCE.md -> exit 3 came from an adopter's green run on zero work.

**Probe by running the binary, not by `command -v`** — a present-but-broken install produces
the same empty output a clean run does.

`tools/preflight.sh` renders 3 as `[SKIP] — NOT verified`, distinct from `[PASS]`, and does
**not** set the failure flag: a developer without the toolchain can still push, they just
cannot mistake a skip for a pass. A `--selftest` whose precondition is absent should print
SKIPPED and exit 0 — going red over a missing engine trains people to ignore a red build,
and an ignored gate is dead. The skip is logged either way, so *"did it ever actually run?"*
stays answerable.

**Why 3 and not 2.** `2` already means different things in different tools here, and a
code that means two things is a code that means nothing.
Evidence: ai/STANDARDS_EVIDENCE.md -> why 3 and not 2.

### A check that stops running looks exactly like a check with nothing to report

**This is the project's dominant failure mode, and it is invisible by construction.** A
hook that is perfectly configured and never invoked records nothing, and an absent
record is indistinguishable from a clean one.
Evidence: ai/STANDARDS_EVIDENCE.md -> a configured hook that never fires is invisible.

None of those was a wrong verdict. Each was an **absent** one, and nothing in a report can
distinguish absence from cleanliness — `setup.sh --check` reports on the checks it *runs*,
which by construction cannot include a check that no longer runs at all.

`tools/scaffold_log.sh` closes that. Every check appends one line — timestamp, tool, verdict
— to `ai/.scaffold-run-log`, and **the timestamp is the useful field, not the verdict**.
`--report` names anything that has not run in 14 days; `sync-check.sh` prints that finding
at session start, and only that finding, because a full table every session is the noise
that gets a report ignored.

Per-machine and gitignored, like `ai/SESSION_JOURNAL.md` — it records what happened on this
box, and committing it would merge several developers' clocks into one file. Rotated by
**age**, not line count: a line cap discards the oldest entries, which are exactly the ones
that answer *when did this last run*.

### Ask GitHub, not only your own machine

**Local green is not CI green, and only one of them is the truth about the project.** Ask
GitHub — `tools/ci_status.sh` — rather than inferring from a clean local run. Re-run it
after every push and before reporting work complete: the session-start hook fires once and
a session outlives it.

**An absent alert feature is not a clean one.** Dependabot, code scanning and secret
scanning each answer separately, and the check reports "not enabled" as its own answer.

How `ci_status.sh` behaves when it cannot ask, and the full ceiling mechanics:
**ai/OPERATIONS.md → Ask GitHub**. Evidence: ai/STANDARDS_EVIDENCE.md -> local green is not
CI green.

### Archive ceilings — DECLARED HERE, because this is the file the tool reads

`tools/session_archive.py` parses `ai/STANDARDS.md` and nothing else, so the marker lives in
this file whatever else moves. All three ship `800/900` — archive at 800 lines, burst at 900
— and neither number ever fails a build.

To set your own, put an **un-backticked** marker at column 0 anywhere in this file. The
example is in backticks on purpose: at column 0 it would be a live declaration, and an
upgrade merging a second one leaves ceilings that depend on which appears first (#180).

`<!-- scaffold:ceilings SESSION.md=800/900 BACKLOG.md=800/900 MEMORY.md=800/900 -->`

The whole always-loaded set has a ceiling too, in bytes, because what a session pays is the
total of the files the load order names and not any one of them. `./setup.sh --check` prints
it; the default is 120 KB and the target is 90 KB. Set your own the same way:
`<!-- scaffold:context-ceiling 120 -->`. Advisory, and it never fails.

Why these numbers, and what each `--check` does when it cannot answer:
**ai/OPERATIONS.md → Ask GitHub**.

### MEMORY.md quality bar
Entries in `ai/MEMORY.md` must be specific enough for someone who wasn't present
to understand and act on them without re-reading the session history.
- Not enough: "Chose requests library"
- Correct: "Chose requests over httpx because httpx async conflicted with the
  existing synchronous Splunk SDK calls"
Review and edit AI-drafted MEMORY.md entries before committing — AI-generated
context files reduce task success rates when left unedited.

**A LIVE entry is a stub too. Only a superseded decision leaves the file entirely.**

`ai/MEMORY.md` is loaded at every session start, so its cost is paid by every future
session forever. What a session start actually needs from a past decision is two things:

1. **What was decided**, so you do not contradict it, with the one measurement or fact that
   makes it stick.
2. **The revisit trigger** — the observable change that would make it wrong.

The *why* and the *alternatives rejected* matter only when someone is about to change the
decision, and that is exactly the moment they will open the archive. So they live in
`ai/MEMORY_ARCHIVE.md`, cross-referenced, not in the file every session pays for.

    ## YYYY-MM-DD — <what was decided>

    - <the decision, plus the one measurement that justifies it>
    - Revisit: <the observable change that would make this wrong> → <what to undo>
    - Full rationale and rejected alternatives: `ai/MEMORY_ARCHIVE.md`

**Why this rule exists.** Work that leaves no trace in git leaves no trace anywhere
else either, and the next session starts from nothing.
Evidence: ai/STANDARDS_EVIDENCE.md -> why the session record rule exists.

## Tool behavior

All AI tools in this project follow these rules regardless of platform:
- Session logs go to: `ai/SESSION.md`
- Backlog and to-do list go to: `ai/BACKLOG.md`
- Persistent decisions and context go to: `ai/MEMORY.md`
- Specs and planning documents go to: `docs/specs/`

### localcoder markers

Read from THIS file at column 0 by `setup.sh --upgrade`: **`scaffold:owns-localcoder` — that
is the whole live set.** `-diverged` and `-forked` are retired and read by nothing; delete any
declaration of either. An indented example is documentation, not a declaration. Meanings and
why the two went: [`tools/README.md`](../tools/README.md) -> *Dual-homing*.


### Skills location
Project skills (SKILL.md format) live canonically in **`.agents/skills/`** — the
cross-tool Agent Skills open standard location, read natively by Codex and others.
Claude Code only scans `.claude/skills/`, so a **byte-identical mirror** is kept there
(created by `setup.sh`, drift-checked by `sync-check.sh`). Always edit the canonical
copy in `.agents/skills/`, then re-run `setup.sh` (or copy manually). Real copies,
not symlinks — symlinks do not survive OneDrive sync.

## Source of truth — ai/ files take precedence

The `ai/` folder is the single source of truth for this project, shared across
all tools and all machines. Some AI tools (including Claude Code) maintain their
own local memory or context systems alongside this folder. When any conflict or
overlap exists between a tool's local memory and the `ai/` files:

- `ai/BACKLOG.md` is the authoritative task list — not any tool's local memory
- `ai/MEMORY.md` is the authoritative decision log — not any tool's local memory
- `ai/SESSION.md` is the authoritative session history — not any tool's local memory

If you are Claude Code and have local memory files (e.g. under `.claude/projects/`),
read them for additional context but write all updates to the `ai/` files only.
Do not create or update local memory backlog or session files — use `ai/BACKLOG.md`
and `ai/SESSION.md` instead.

## Multi-user rules

When more than one person or tool works in this repo:
- Never commit directly to `main` — always branch and PR
- Use the PR template in `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`
- `ai/SESSION.md` and `ai/BACKLOG.md` are append-only — on merge conflicts,
  keep all entries from both sides. `.gitattributes` enforces this with git's
  built-in **union merge** driver (both sides kept automatically; any ordering
  cosmetics get tidied in the next commit)
- `ai/MEMORY.md` conflicts must be resolved by the project owner manually —
  never auto-merge this file. It is deliberately excluded from union merge:
  decision entries get *edited* (superseded → stub), and union would silently
  interleave two edits with no conflict marker
- See `ai/TEAM.md` for ownership and escalation

## What must never be gitignored — the record travels with the project

**Anyone who clones this project gets its whole history to date.** That is the point of
keeping the record in files rather than in a conversation, and it only works if the record is
actually in the repository.

**Never ignore these. They are the project's durable memory:**

| File | Why it travels |
|---|---|
| `ai/MEMORY.md` | The decisions and gotchas. Also **injected into local-model drafts as hard constraints**, so a developer without it gets different output from one who has it. |
| `ai/SESSION.md` | What happened and why, including the closeout table. |
| `ai/BACKLOG.md` | What is outstanding, and what was already decided against. |
| `ai/*_ARCHIVE.md` | **Every archive.** These exist *because* the live files have a ceiling — the history moved there rather than being deleted. Ignoring an archive turns a rotation into a data loss. |
| `ai/CODING.md`, `ai/STANDARDS.md`, `ai/PLANNING.md`, `ai/SECURITY.md` | The rules. A rule nobody receives is not a rule. |

**Ignore only what is genuinely per-developer or per-machine**, and say why in the
`.gitignore` line itself so the next person does not have to guess:

| Ignored | Reason |
|---|---|
| `ai/SESSION_JOURNAL.md` | Per-developer working state, appended on every session start. Tracked, it makes the tree permanently dirty and then records that fact on the next turn. It is **distilled into `ai/SESSION.md`**, which does travel. |
| `ai/.scaffold-run-log` | Per-machine. Committing it merges several developers' clocks into one file and conflicts on every push. |
| `.localcoder-log.jsonl` | Holds **raw prompt text**, which can contain source and, in a bad configuration, secrets. The *outcomes* belong in the shared record and get there through `tools/close_out.py`; the raw prompts do not. |

**The test to apply to a new entry:** would a developer who clones this repository tomorrow
be missing something they need in order to understand a decision already taken? If yes, it is
not ignorable — find another way to solve whatever made you reach for `.gitignore`.

**A distinction worth keeping straight.** The scaffold itself ships **no archives** — an
adopter starts with empty `ai/` files and accumulates their own. That is not a contradiction
of the rule above: our history is not part of what an adopter receives, and theirs is not
part of what we ship. The rule is about a *project* travelling to its own developers.

## Git workflow — merge only

This org uses a merge-only workflow. Rebasing is not used.

**Starting new work:**
```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/your-work
```

**Committing and opening a PR:**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "type(scope): description"
git push origin feature/your-work
# Then open a Pull Request in GitHub
```

**Keeping your branch current while the PR is open:**
If another PR is merged into main before yours, bring your branch up to date
by merging main into it — never rebase:
```bash
git checkout feature/your-work
git fetch origin
git merge origin/main
git push origin feature/your-work
```

**After your PR is merged:**
```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
# Then start your next branch from the updated main
```

**If merge conflicts occur:**
Fix the conflicts in the affected files, then:
```bash
git add .
git commit
git push origin feature/your-work
```

## Versioning standard

`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.YYYYMMDD.HHMM`. **PATCH by default; MINOR only for a genuinely new
capability; MAJOR needs a person's explicit sign-off.** A stamp may not go backwards from
the newest non-exempt tag and may not sit in the future — fabricate one and the next honest
release sorts *earlier* than its predecessor.

**An unreleased fix does not exist.** Adopters resolve from the newest GitHub release, so a
bumped `version` with no tag and no release behind it ships to nobody while looking correct
locally.

`tools/release_status.sh` and `tools/header_check.sh` enforce all of this. The full rules and
what each check does when it cannot answer: **ai/OPERATIONS.md → Versioning standard**.

### File-header baseline — DECLARED HERE, for the same reason

A rule introduced in release N must not retroactively fail work done before N.
`tools/header_check.sh` reads its baseline from `ai/STANDARDS.md` and nowhere else, so the
marker lives in this file. Files older than the date are exempt until they are next edited;
until you declare one, the check reports a GAP rather than a pass.

<!-- scaffold:header-baseline — not declared; the form to use is shown below -->

    <!-- scaffold:header-baseline YYYY-MM-DD -->

Declare it with `tools/header_check.sh --adopt`. Indented above on purpose: the tool reads
column 0. Why the rule exists: **ai/OPERATIONS.md → File-header baseline**.

## Versioning — this repository ships no artifact

<!-- scaffold:no-artifact -->

`zmwapps.com` is static HTML served directly by GitHub Pages. There is no build, no
package and nothing to version: what is on `main` is what is live, and a version file
would describe a release that does not exist.

The one page with real logic, `viewer.html`, carries its own `Modified:` header and is
smoke-tested by `tools/viewer_smoke.js` against a collection export.
