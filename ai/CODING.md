## Drafting brief (what a local model is given)

`localcoder` injects ONLY this block, not the whole file. Keep it short, imperative,
and about the code being written — **it is a prompt, not documentation.** Everything outside
this block is for humans and cloud agents.

- <language + version, e.g. "Typed GDScript, Godot 4.7. No C#." or "Python 3.13, never assume 3.11">
- <indentation and line length — be explicit, models get this wrong>
- <whether file-header comment blocks are wanted; say NO explicitly if they are not>
- <doc-comment convention, and that comments should say WHY>
- <the two or three type-system traps this language actually has>
- Never invent an API. If unsure a method exists, say so in a comment rather than guessing —
  a plausible wrong method name is the most expensive thing you can produce.
- Guard inside the function that does the work, not only in its caller.

<!-- Per-language blocks (localcoder:begin:python), the ~1,500-token budget, and what to
keep OUT of the block: tools/README.md -> The drafting brief. No block at all also works. -->

## General

- Write code for the next person to read, not just the next run
- One function, one responsibility
- No commented-out dead code in commits
- Prefer clarity over cleverness
- Files over 300 lines should be split into smaller modules

## Naming conventions

| Context | Style | Example |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Files | kebab-case | user-auth-helper.js |
| JS/TS variables and functions | camelCase | getUserToken() |
| Python variables and functions | snake_case | get_user_token() |
| Constants | UPPER_SNAKE_CASE | MAX_RETRY_COUNT |
| Classes | PascalCase | UserAuthService |
| Bash functions | lowercase_with_underscores | check_dependencies() |
| Bash local variables | lowercase_with_underscores | file_path |
| Bash constants / env vars | ALL_CAPS_SNAKE_CASE | MAX_RETRY_COUNT |

## File headers

Every source file — code, config, or markup — must begin with a header block
identifying what it is and tracking its change history. The exact format varies
by file type but must always include: project/app name, filename, last modified
date, current version, purpose, and a changelog.

**Generic format:**
```
# Project:  <project_name>
# File:     <filename>
# Modified: YYYY-MM-DD
# Version:  MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.YYYYMMDD.HHMM
# Purpose:  <one-line description>
# Changelog:
#   YYYY-MM-DD vX.X.X — <description>
#   YYYY-MM-DD vX.X.X — Initial creation
```

Project-type overlays define the exact header format for their file types
(e.g. `.conf` files in Splunk, YAML frontmatter in skills).

**Exemption:** living Markdown documents whose history belongs to git — the `ai/` standards
and context files, READMEs, and docs — carry no embedded header; `git log` is their
changelog. Headers are for *deliverables* (code, configs, scripts, skills), where the file
travels away from the repo and needs its identity and history to travel with it.

A project may exempt **additional file classes** where headers don't fit the tooling —
engine-managed script files (e.g. Godot/Unity), generated code, formats without comment
syntax. Declare the exemption in the project's `ai/CODING.md` and record the rationale
in `ai/MEMORY.md`; the header rule is tool-scoped, not universal.

**`Modified:` must move when the file does.** A stale header is worse than a missing one:
it reads as deliberate, so the next person trusts a date that is wrong and concludes a
comment describing a measurement still describes the code. This rule went unchecked until
2026-08-04, and the scaffold itself was the clearest violator — `setup.sh` carried
`0.3.1.20260709.1050` through four later commits across two releases, `session_archive.py`
had no `Version:` line, `sync-check.sh` had no header at all. Nobody was careless; nothing
was watching, which is the same reason `SESSION.md` reached 1,001 lines against a stated
~150.

**PROSE FILES CARRY NO DATE LINE, AND THAT IS THE SAME RULE, NOT AN EXCEPTION TO IT.**
Markdown under `ai/`, `docs/` and `overlays/` used to open with `_Last updated: YYYY-MM-DD_`.
Measured 2026-08-09: **23 of 24 overlay files** claimed a date older than the file's last
real change, by as much as four months — and the convention was absent from the eight core
`ai/` files entirely, so it was neither universal nor true.

The reason it rotted is the reason `Modified:` did not: nothing watched it. But the fix here
is deletion rather than a checker, because unlike a source header — which carries `Version:`
and `Changelog:` that git does not know — a bare date on a prose file is a hand-maintained
copy of `git log -1`, which is exact, free, and cannot drift. **Two definitions that can
disagree, where one of them is already authoritative.** A claim you do not make cannot go
stale; substance that belongs in the file stays in the file, as content.

`tools/header_check.sh` watches it now, and CI runs it:

```bash
tools/header_check.sh                        # every source file has a complete header
tools/header_check.sh --since origin/main    # everything you changed was re-stamped
tools/header_check.sh --adopt                # adopting into existing code — see below
tools/header_check.sh --list-legacy          # what the baseline is still exempting
tools/header_check.sh --selftest             # prove the checker fails what it should

tools/preflight.sh                           # this, plus every other gate CI runs
```

`--since` covers the committed diff, the working tree **and** files git does not know about
yet. That last one was a real hole: every file list came from `git ls-files` until 0.3.0, so
a source file you had just created and not yet `git add`ed reported clean here and failed CI
on the commit that added it.

**Adopting this into an existing codebase: the rule applies forward.** Turning the check on
in a mature project fails every file written before the standard was — measured on a real
upgrade, 33 files at once, and the pull request could not merge. Run `--adopt` once. It
records the date in `ai/STANDARDS.md` (a file upgrades merge rather than overwrite) and
exempts files older than it, **until you edit one** — then it is in scope like anything
else. The exempt count prints on every run, so the amnesty stays visible rather than
becoming the new normal. Full rule: `ai/STANDARDS.md` → *File-header baseline*.

## Documentation

- Every function gets a docstring or JSDoc comment
- Document the why, not just the what
- README stays current with every major change
- Inline comments only when logic is non-obvious

## Version control

Commit message format: `type(scope): description`

```
feat(auth): add session token refresh on expiry
fix(parser): correct line break handling for multi-line events
docs(readme): update install steps for v1.2.0
chore(deps): pin splunk-sdk to 1.7.4
refactor(macros): consolidate auth failure lookup macros
test(inputs): add unit tests for modular input retry logic
```

| Type | Use for |
|------|---------|
| `feat` | New feature or capability |
| `fix` | Bug fix |
| `docs` | Documentation only |
| `chore` | Build, deps, tooling — no logic change |
| `refactor` | Code restructure — no behavior change |
| `test` | Adding or updating tests |
| `style` | Formatting only — no logic change |

Rules:
- Never commit directly to main
- Branch names use prefixes: `feature/`, `fix/`, `chore/`
- Every release tagged using project versioning standard (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.YYYYMMDD.HHMM)
- Scope is the component, file, or module being changed — keep it short

## Dependencies

- Pin dependency versions in all lock files
- Review new packages before adding — check license and last updated date
- Run dependency audit before each release
- Prefer well-maintained packages with active communities

## Local coder (optional)

A local LLM drafts; the orchestrating agent reviews, tests and verifies. What to delegate,
the review gate, limits, setup, config: [`tools/README.md`](../tools/README.md) -> *Local
coder* — kept out of this always-loaded file. Policy: `localcoder --delegation`.
