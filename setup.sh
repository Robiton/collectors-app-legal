# Changelog:
#   2026-09-06 v0.27.0.20260906.1244 — --check REACHES THE ADOPTION THAT NEVER UPGRADES (#303). The
#                        <=v0.3.0 `ln -s AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md` instruction lives in AGENTS.md,
#                        a MERGE file, in a repository we do not own. scaffold_upgrade.sh
#                        migrates it, which closes it for upgraders and for nobody else --
#                        and an adopter runs --check far more often than they upgrade.
#                        Two detections, because the artefact outlives the sentence: the
#                        instruction still present, and CLAUDE.md actually being a symlink
#                        (somebody may have run the command once and later deleted the
#                        paragraph). SAME PATTERN AS THE MIGRATION, deliberately -- one
#                        hazard definition, two callers, so they cannot drift apart.
#                        A FAILURE, not an advisory. Everything else --check reports is
#                        hygiene; this destroys the file carrying every rule, and it does so
#                        the moment somebody follows their own documentation. Measured on a
#                        real adoption: AGENTS.md 86 bytes -> 11.
#   2026-09-06 v0.26.2.20260906.0406 — --check reports the auto-memory count (#300). Placed with
#                        the archive advisory because that is where a reader already looks for
#                        ai/ hygiene, and it is advisory for the same reason: nothing here can
#                        fail a build.
#   2026-09-04 v0.26.1.20260904.0853 — the CLAUDE.md remediation string was a FOURTH site of the symlink
#                        data-loss bug (#305). `printf > CLAUDE.md` follows a legacy <=v0.3.0
#                        symlink and truncates AGENTS.md; three guide sites were guarded and the
#                        one the TOOL emits was missed — handed to exactly the population that
#                        still has the symlink. Now detects the symlink and the legacy gitignore
#                        line separately, and names the real cause of each.
#   2026-09-04 v0.26.0.20260904.0224 — create_if_absent(): AN OVERLAY STUB IS A STARTING POINT, NOT A RESET (#299).
#                        #292 fixed `cat > .gitignore` in one overlay; the same shape was in
#                        every other one. Measured across all seven against a project that
#                        already had content: `version` was reset from 9.9.9 to 0.1.0 by ALL
#                        SEVEN — despite ADOPTION_GUIDE.md saying in so many words that the
#                        file is the adopter's and is deliberately not copied — and the
#                        security-tool overlay replaced a filled-in docs/THREAT_MODEL.md with
#                        an empty stub. Every overlay stub goes through create_if_absent now,
#                        and `version` is kept with setup saying which value it would have
#                        written. ai/MEMORY.md, ai/BACKLOG.md, ai/SESSION.md, ai/TEAM.md and
#                        the three *_ARCHIVE.md files were already safe and are now asserted.
#   2026-09-03 v0.25.0.20260903.1906 — THREE ADOPTION DEFECTS, ALL FOUND BY AN OUTSIDE REVIEWER READING A REAL
#                       ADOPTION rather than by anything in this repository (#291, #292, #296).
#                       (1) The splunk-app overlay did `cat > .gitignore` — overwrite, no
#                       backup, no message — for existing apps as well as new ones. Following
#                       ADOPTION_GUIDE.md in its own order (step 4 appends the secret rules,
#                       step 6 applies the overlay) destroyed every one of them, plus whatever
#                       the project already had, plus `.localcoder-audit.jsonl*` which this
#                       same script appends 400 lines above under a comment reading "the
#                       ordering is unforgiving". Now gitignore_ensure_lines(): exact-line,
#                       append-only, one code path.
#                       (2) build.sh's exclusion list excluded 6 of the 20 scaffold artifacts
#                       an adoption carries, so a CORRECTLY BUILT Splunk package still put
#                       tools/, .claude/, .github/ and setup.sh onto a production host. It is
#                       generated from tools/adoption_manifest.sh now, and setup.sh REFUSES to
#                       write a build.sh if the generator is missing or produces nothing.
#                       (3) monorepo_notice(): a project below a repository root gets an inert
#                       .github/ and hooks that never fire, and nothing said so. The string
#                       `monorepo` appeared in this repository exactly once before today — in
#                       a comment explaining why we stop at one level.
#                       Also: the audit-log rule asked `[ -d .git ]`, which is FALSE in a
#                       monorepo subdirectory, so the one adoption shape that most needs it
#                       never got it. Asks git now. And the generated build.sh said `App:`
#                       where header_check wants `Project:`, so every Splunk adoption failed
#                       its own `setup.sh --check` on a file we wrote.
#   2026-09-02 v0.24.0.20260902.0517 — the always-loaded TARGET is 90 KB, set by the owner
#                        (#281). It was 80, which the product could not meet without moving
#                        rules out of the load order. 90 is met with room: a fresh adoption
#                        measures 78 KB once ai/OPERATIONS.md carries the reference half.
#                        THE TARGET AND THE CEILING ARE DIFFERENT NUMBERS ON PURPOSE. The
#                        target is what the product is trying to be; the 120 KB ceiling is
#                        where an ADOPTER hears about their own growth. Collapsing them would
#                        mean either a product that is red on arrival or a ceiling that never
#                        speaks.
#   2026-09-01 v0.23.0.20260901.1656 — --check MEASURES WHAT EVERY SESSION PAYS BEFORE THE
#                        FIRST INSTRUCTION (#280). Nothing counted the always-loaded set, and
#                        it grew the way an append-only file always does: 95 KB here, 156 KB
#                        in Robiton/localcoder, 179 in localcoder-dev, 211 in
#                        ai-project-scaffold-dev -- roughly 54k tokens, a quarter of a
#                        context window. ai/SESSION.md is counted AS THE LOAD ORDER READS
#                        IT (--session-head), not as it sits on disk, so the number is a
#                        cost somebody actually pays.
#                        THE DEFAULT IS 120 KB AND THE TARGET IS 80. 80 was the number asked
#                        for and could not be the default: a FRESH adoption measures 85 KB
#                        after this release's trim, so 80 would redden every adopter on the
#                        day they adopt -- how a check gets ignored, per ai/SECURITY.md's own
#                        rule. Per project via `<!-- scaffold:context-ceiling <KB> -->`.
#   2026-09-01 v0.23.0.20260901.1656 — --install-hooks: the printed remedy now terminates
#                        (#274). Reported from Robiton/godsfall, which followed it exactly:
#                        the orphan scan listed every executable non-sample hook in
#                        .git/hooks and refused unconditionally, while the message said "copy
#                        the ones you want into .githooks/ first, then re-run this" -- and
#                        re-running refused again. core.hooksPath had to be set by hand on a
#                        repository with 1,746 LFS-tracked files.
#                        COVERED IS NOT THE SAME AS PRESENT. A .githooks/<name> that does not
#                        chain to .git/hooks/<name> silences the original as completely as no
#                        file at all, while looking like the fix. So a covering hook is
#                        skipped only when it reaches the real hooks directory through `git
#                        rev-parse --git-dir`; anything else is refused BY NAME as UNCHAINED.
#                        COMMENTS ARE STRIPPED BEFORE THE MATCH, because the paragraph in
#                        each shipped hook explaining the chain contains the same words as
#                        the chain, and would otherwise pass a hook that only describes it.
#                        A fixture proves all three cases: chaining installs, unchained is
#                        refused by name, a genuine orphan is still refused.
#                        AND header_check's output is replayed on failure instead of "run it
#                        for the detail" -- the same shape --assert-consistent already uses
#                        180 lines above, on a branch that already has the answer (#277).
#   2026-09-01 v0.22.4.20260901.0435 — TWO VERDICTS FOR ONE FILE IN ONE RUN (#265). The
#                        required-files loop printed a bare `[OK]   ai/MEMORY.md` and the
#                        archive block a few lines later printed `[!] [over] ai/MEMORY.md:
#                        873 lines`. The reassuring one came first and unqualified, so anyone
#                        scanning the tag column -- which is what a tag column is for -- took
#                        the [OK]. That loop only ever asked whether the file EXISTS; it now
#                        says "present", and the [over] branch names the one-command fix the
#                        [BURST] branch already named.
#   2026-08-31 v0.22.3.20260831.1546 — REFUSES BEFORE IT WRITES when run outside the scaffold. Every template
#                        path here is relative, so the script only works when the current
#                        directory IS the scaffold -- and running it from the TARGET, the
#                        obvious reading of "adopt the scaffold into my project", created
#                        .claude, .cursor, .github and CLAUDE.md and then died on
#                        `ai/MEMORY.md: No such file or directory`, leaving a half-configured
#                        repo that LOOKS adopted. Now exits 2 with the correct route, having
#                        written nothing. The guard sits immediately above the first write:
#                        its first placement was ~100 lines lower, where it refused correctly
#                        while its own message "Nothing has been created" was false.
#   2026-08-31 v0.22.2.20260831.0904 — #249 second instance of the same class, not named in the issue: mktemp -t failed soft here,
#                        so on Linux the scaffold:no-artifact strip silently did nothing.
#   2026-08-30 v0.22.1.20260830.0023 — THREE DEFECTS IN v0.22.0, FOUND BY TESTING THE EDGE CASES
#                        RATHER THAN THE HAPPY PATH. (1) `grep -v` exits 1 when it filters
#                        EVERY line and `set -e` is in force from line 224, so an
#                        ai/BACKLOG.md consisting of nothing but the scaffold:session-log
#                        declaration ABORTED setup.sh two thirds of the way through -- exit 1,
#                        no message. `|| true` on both strippers; the must-run one had the
#                        same latent flaw and is fixed with it. (2) The settings.json write
#                        was open("w"), which truncates before it writes -- an interrupt left
#                        the adopter's file empty. Now a sibling temp plus os.replace, which
#                        is atomic. (3) realpath() so a symlinked settings.json is written
#                        THROUGH rather than replaced. Regression-tested in adoption_check,
#                        and the test was itself mutation-proved by reverting the fix.
#   2026-08-30 v0.22.0.20260830.0005 — HOOKS ARE MERGED, NEVER SKIPPED, and there is now ONE copy
#                        of them. .claude/settings.hooks.json is the canonical set; setup.sh
#                        merges it into .claude/settings.json, replacing only the `hooks` key
#                        and preserving every sibling the adopter owns. TWO bugs, one cause:
#                        (#246) an existing settings.json -- the normal state of any repo
#                        where Claude Code has ever run, i.e. the whole adoption population --
#                        was SKIPPED, so the adopter got no hooks at all; and the heredoc that
#                        wrote the file when it was absent had drifted to ONE of SIX commands,
#                        so even a fresh project lost the session journal, correction capture,
#                        SessionEnd and both PreCompact hooks. A malformed settings.json is
#                        left untouched rather than overwritten -- it is the adopter's file.
#                        --check now compares the HOOKS, not the file's existence: it reported
#                        [OK] on an empty object, exactly the state the skip left behind.
#                        ALSO (#244): the inherited `scaffold:session-log` declaration is
#                        stripped from ai/BACKLOG.md for a new project, unless the -dev sibling
#                        it names actually exists. Same class as the scaffold:must-run
#                        stripper directly above it.
#   2026-08-18 v0.21.0.20260818.1442 — setup.sh SHEDS an inherited scaffold:no-artifact
#                        declaration when it writes a version file. Same class as overlays/
#                        and OVERVIEW.md, and found by the invariant check added one release
#                        earlier: a template cloned from a repo that ships NOTHING inherits
#                        its declaration, setup.sh then writes `version`, and the new project
#                        makes two opposite claims about itself. Nothing noticed while the
#                        check was workflow-only, because it never ran in a fresh project.
#   2026-08-18 v0.20.0.20260818.1156 — --check asserts the version INVARIANT, not just the version
#                        FILE's existence. Printing `[OK] version file` proved a file was
#                        there; it never proved `version` and `.scaffold-version` agreed, and
#                        upstream they drifted fourteen releases apart. Calls
#                        tools/scaffold_version.sh --assert-consistent rather than restating
#                        the rule.
#   2026-08-18 v0.19.0.20260818.0753 — the archive check reports the WORSE state loudly instead of
#                        silently (#227 family). It grepped the report for `[over]`, which
#                        does not match `[BURST]`, so a file past its burst line printed
#                        `[OK] ai/ files under their archive lines` while a file merely over
#                        the archive line was reported -- quieter as the breach got worse.
#                        Now branches on session_archive.py --exit-status: 2 prints [!!] with
#                        the burst wording, 1 prints [!], 0 is the only path to [OK].
#   2026-08-16 v0.18.0.20260816.0100 — THE LOCALCODER AUDIT LOG IS IGNORED BEFORE IT EXISTS
#                        (localcoder#94). It records draft bodies, verify output and MCP tool
#                        ARGUMENTS AND RESULTS verbatim, so it can hold a bearer token passed
#                        to a server and every row a query returned, and it is not redacted by
#                        default — deliberately, for reasons in localcoder's docs/AUDIT.md.
#                        ADDED HERE RATHER THAN LEFT TO A WARNING because the ordering is
#                        unforgiving: the file is created by the first drafting run, and the
#                        window between that run and the next `git add -A` is often one
#                        command. A warning printed inside that window arrives at the same
#                        moment as the risk. Appends only, only when absent, only in a repo,
#                        keeps a backup, and SCAFFOLD_SKIP_GITIGNORE=1 opts out.
#   2026-08-15 v0.17.0.20260815.1100 — A SCANNER THAT DIES ON A SIGNAL IS REPORTED AS A CRASH, NOT A FINDING
#                        (#212). The adopter saw `[FAIL] tools/marker_scan.sh:` followed by
#                        NOTHING — a process killed by a signal has no output to echo. A red
#                        with no finding is worse for a human than a false green: the false
#                        green is quiet, this one sends someone hunting a defect in their own
#                        repository that was never there.
#                        rc > 128 is now named as a signal and stated to be a crash in the
#                        scanner; a non-zero exit with no output at all is named too.
#                        `|| scanner_rc=$?` IS LOAD-BEARING. The first version used a bare
#                        assignment, and under `set -e` a failing command substitution in an
#                        assignment aborts the shell — so the crashing scanner took the whole
#                        of `--check` down with it, exit 139, scanner never named. Strictly
#                        worse than the defect it fixed, and caught by the new fixture on its
#                        first run.
#   2026-08-15 v0.16.0.20260815.0800 — A NEW PROJECT NO LONGER INHERITS THE SOURCE REPO'S must-run
#                        DECLARATION. `<!-- scaffold:must-run tests/audit_localcoder.sh -->`
#                        names somebody else's behavioural suite; a project set up from a clone
#                        inherited it and preflight then refused to go green without a suite
#                        that is not theirs. Same class as .github/CODEOWNERS reading
#                        `* @Robiton`, and found the same way — by the failure finally being
#                        visible. It surfaced the moment preflight stopped printing PASSED over
#                        a failing must-run gate (preflight 0.19.1).
#                        THE RULE IS NOT WEAKENED: a declared gate that cannot run is still a
#                        failure. What was wrong is inheriting the declaration.
#                        GUARDED ON --name, and that guard is load-bearing. An EXISTING adopter
#                        declares its own suite legitimately, and silently retiring that would
#                        be the worst outcome in this file — a gate the repository said it
#                        cannot go green without, gone, with the verdict still green.
#   2026-08-12 v0.15.0 — THE TENTH COPY OF is_upstream_repo, and the worst one. This file
#                        tested `setup.sh` as its third signal — a file EVERY ADOPTER HAS BY
#                        DEFINITION — so all three conjuncts held downstream and the AGENTS.md
#                        placeholder check could not fire in ANY adoption. It printed
#                        "[OK] AGENTS.md (template repo — placeholders expected)" at real
#                        projects with real unfilled commands. Reported from godsfall (#208).
#   2026-08-12 v0.14.0 — A FRESH SETUP NOW SHEDS THE SCAFFOLD'S OWN REPO FILES. A new project
#                        is created by CLONING this repository (QUICK_START step 1), so it
#                        arrives carrying overlays/, OVERVIEW.md and mirror-sync.yml — the
#                        three signals is_upstream_repo() keys on. Until they went, every tool
#                        classified the adopter's project as THE SCAFFOLD, and the two gates
#                        scoped upstream-only on 2026-08-11 *so they could not do this* failed
#                        the adopter's first real commit: writing a dated ai/SESSION.md entry,
#                        which AGENTS.md instructs on every session, failed the
#                        shipped-ai-templates gate, and this repo's 28-line prose ratchet was
#                        enforced on their project. Measured end to end from the published
#                        0.37.1 tarball. .github/CODEOWNERS goes too — it reads `* @Robiton`,
#                        so their pull requests would request review from us.
#   2026-08-12 v0.13.1 — One line adjudicated for tools/stale_path_scan.sh: the sentence
#                        EXPLAINING that tools/localcoder left in W-15 is printed advice
#                        naming a path that is not there, which is exactly what that scanner
#                        looks for and exactly what its exemption exists for. Same trap the
#                        W-15 no-execution gate hit — it fired on this file's echo telling a
#                        developer what to install, a gate forbidding its own remedy.
#   2026-08-12 v0.13.0 — DETECT THE PRE-SPLIT VENDORED localcoder ON PATH. `command -v`
#                        succeeding is not "the product is installed", and ai/STANDARDS.md
#                        says exactly that — *probe by running the binary, not by
#                        `command -v`* — a rule this block broke while shipping the file
#                        that states it. Until W-15 tools/README.md said to
#                        `install -m 0755 tools/localcoder ~/bin/localcoder`; anyone who did
#                        has one on PATH forever, because the upgrader does not delete (A7).
#                        Found on this project's own machine: ~/bin/localcoder at 0.8.0,
#                        header `Project: ai-project-scaffold`, against a product at 0.31.2,
#                        with `uv tool list` showing localcoder not installed at all.
#   2026-08-12 v0.12.2 — The --check summary named `tools/audit_localcoder.sh`, gone in W-15.
#                        A PRINTED string, so every adopter running --check read it. The doc
#                        sweep in 0.36.7 covered the .md files and missed the prose inside
#                        tools/ — prose is prose wherever it lives.
#   2026-08-12 v0.12.1 — `grep -c` PRINTS "0" AND EXITS 1 on no matches, so `|| echo 0` made
#                        `placeholders` the two-line string "0\n0" and every numeric test on
#                        it died with `integer expression expected`. Swept after the identical
#                        line in scaffold-check.yml was found unable to fire AT ALL — that
#                        copy reported "SESSION.md has 0\n0 session entries." on every run of
#                        every adopting repository, which reads as a pass. Six sites, one
#                        idiom; fixing the one that was seen would have left five.
#   2026-08-11 v0.12.0 — --install-hooks / --uninstall-hooks (#171). A repo's hooks do not
#                        ship with its clone: .git/hooks is not versioned, so any rule
#                        enforced by a hook is enforced on whoever happened to install it —
#                        and it LOOKS enforced from the inside, which is the worse half.
#                        OPT-IN AND NEVER PART OF A NORMAL SETUP. A 25-second pre-push hook
#                        installed without asking is the guard ai/SECURITY.md warns about:
#                        it blocks legitimate work, gets ripped out, and then protects
#                        nothing. Undo is one visible command.
#                        REFUSES IF IT WOULD SILENCE HOOKS YOU ALREADY HAVE. core.hooksPath
#                        is EXCLUSIVE — setting it disables .git/hooks entirely, and
#                        git-lfs puts four hooks there that announce nothing. A dropped LFS
#                        pre-push means the push succeeds and the binaries never upload: a
#                        silent data failure traded for a convenience gate. pre-push itself
#                        is chained rather than replaced, so only the others are at risk
#                        and the refusal names them.
#   2026-08-09 v0.10.2 — The summary says what [!] means (#182). An adopter read
#                        '[!] no overlay applied' directly above 'all hard checks passed'
#                        and could not tell which to believe. Both are true; only one is
#                        a gate, and now the line that claims success says so.
#   2026-08-09 v0.10.1 — `--check`'s closing note points at tools/preflight.sh (#166). It
#                        already named the three things it does not cover, which was honest
#                        and left the reader to assemble the rest by hand — and every hand
#                        assembly of that list omitted something different.
#   2026-08-09 v0.10.0 — `--check` records each verdict via tools/scaffold_log.sh, so a
#                        check that stops being run becomes visible. Nothing here could
#                        show that before: a report covers the checks it RUNS, and by
#                        construction that excludes one that no longer runs at all.
#   2026-08-09 v0.9.0 — `--check` runs the vendored checks it had been skipping. It
#                        verified 4 things and printed "all hard checks passed" while CI
#                        ran 13 — header_check.sh, localcoder_sync.py and
#                        session_archive.py are all vendored, offline and fast, and none
#                        was invoked. A human got a narrower answer than the build, and
#                        the narrower one was the reassuring one: the same divergence the
#                        secret scan already cost this file. It now also NAMES what it
#                        does not cover, because "all hard checks passed" was true of the
#                        checks it ran and false as a claim about the scaffold.
#   2026-08-09 v0.8.0 — The SessionStart hook LOOKS for the repo instead of assuming it
#                        is standing in it. `[ -f sync-check.sh ]` resolves against the
#                        session working directory, and on this project's own machine —
#                        where sessions open in the PARENT of three scaffold repos, the
#                        layout its own AGENTS.md prescribes — that guard was false every
#                        time and `|| true` swallowed it. The session-start check had
#                        never run once. Not degraded: never run, and invisible because a
#                        hook whose every failure path is `|| true` cannot report doing
#                        nothing. Now scans the working directory and one level below,
#                        running wherever ai/STANDARDS.md says there is a real adoption.
#   2026-08-08 v0.7.0 — `--check` runs every tools/*_scan.sh instead of carrying its own
#                        copy of the secret regex. The copy it carried was scoped to `ai/`
#                        while tools/secret_scan.sh scans the whole tracked tree, so the
#                        verification a human reads at the end of ./setup.sh was the
#                        narrower of two disagreeing answers — reassuring, and wrong.
#                        Discovery rather than a name also means tools/conflict_scan.sh is
#                        covered without an edit here, which is the point: a listed step is
#                        the next thing to go stale.
#   2026-08-08 v0.6.4 — The "fetch the upgrade tool" hint is gh api, not curl (#136).
#   2026-08-06 v0.6.3 — `--check` can find a dated SESSION.md entry (#96). The pattern
#                        required a bare date while the shipped template prescribes
#                        `## [YYYY-MM-DD]`, so it could never match a correctly-formatted
#                        file: following the template earned a permanent warning, and the
#                        only way to silence it was to stop following the template. The
#                        bracket is now optional. Two things make this worth more than the
#                        one character it took — a warning nobody can action trains people
#                        to skim `[!]` lines in the same output that carries skills drift
#                        and the header baseline, and .github/workflows/scaffold-check.yml
#                        held a second copy of the identical pattern, fixed here too.
#   2026-08-05 v0.6.2 — Anchor the no-artifact marker to column 0: the documented example
#                        in ai/STANDARDS.md would otherwise read as a declaration. Latent,
#                        masked only because the scaffold has a version file and the check
#                        short-circuits before reaching that branch.
#   2026-08-05 v0.6.1 — `--check` honours `<!-- scaffold:no-artifact -->` in ai/STANDARDS.md:
#                        a repo that ships nothing correctly has no version file. Declared,
#                        never inferred — absence alone still fails, because inferring it
#                        would turn a real omission into a silent pass.
#   2026-08-04 v0.6.0 — `--upgrade` delegates to tools/scaffold_upgrade.sh. Upgrading is a
#                        different job from initialising, and the upgrader must re-exec
#                        itself from a temp copy because the upgrade replaces tools/ while
#                        it runs — neither fits inside this script.
#   2026-08-04 v0.5.0 — Stamp correction, not a behaviour change. This header read
#                        0.3.1.20260709.1050 while the file had been modified in four
#                        later commits across two releases — the scaffold that publishes
#                        the header rule was the clearest violation of it, because
#                        nothing checked. tools/header_check.sh now does, and CI runs it.
#                        Substantive changes made under the stale stamp, recorded here so
#                        the history is not lost: the CLAUDE.md un-gitignore upgrade path,
#                        the skills-drift and secret-scan check fixes, .scaffold-version
#                        separation, and the optional local-coder integration notice.
#   2026-07-09 v0.3.1 — TEAM.md seeding matches the new generic placeholder row
#                        (ai/ context files are now clean templates)
#   2026-07-09 v0.3.0 — CLAUDE.md is now a committed '@AGENTS.md' pointer file, not a
#                        gitignored symlink (OneDrive/Windows-safe; loads in session 1)
#   2026-07-09 v0.2.0 — Non-interactive flags (--type/--name/--owner/...), --check
#                        verifier, setup ends with a verification pass, generated
#                        build.sh aligned with the Splunk overlay standard

AI Project Scaffold setup — interactive by default; flags enable non-interactive
(AI-driven) setup. Run with no flags to be prompted.

Usage: ./setup.sh [flags]
       ./setup.sh --check        # verify an existing setup, change nothing
       ./setup.sh --upgrade      # move an existing project to a newer scaffold release

Flags:
  --type <t>            Project type: base, ai-skill, splunk-app, security-tool,
                        python-script, it-automation, api-integration
                        (providing --type switches to non-interactive mode)
  --name <n>            Project name
  --owner <o>           Your name (for SESSION.md and TEAM.md)
  --version <v>         Initial MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (default: 0.1.0)
  --splunk-new          Splunk app: new app (scaffold directory structure)
  --splunk-existing     Splunk app: existing app (standards only)
  --splunk-app-type <t> ucc | conf | tbd            (default: tbd)
  --splunk-version <v>  9.0 | 9.3 | 10              (default: 9.3)
  --splunk-deploy <d>   onprem | cloud | both       (default: both)
  --check               Run setup verification only and exit (0 = correct)
  --install-hooks       Opt in to .githooks (pre-push runs tools/preflight.sh).
                        Refuses if it would silence hooks you already have.
  --uninstall-hooks     Undo the above (git config --unset core.hooksPath)
  -h, --help            Show this help

Examples:
  ./setup.sh --type base --name my-project --owner "Jane Doe"
  ./setup.sh --type splunk-app --name TA-vendor-product --owner "Jane Doe" \\
             --splunk-new --splunk-app-type conf --splunk-version 9.3 --splunk-deploy onprem

# ---- IS THIS PROJECT THE REPOSITORY, OR A DIRECTORY INSIDE ONE? (#296)
#
# The scaffold assumes the project it adopts into IS a repository root, and that assumption
# is load-bearing in three places that all fail SILENTLY when it does not hold:
#
#   - GitHub discovers workflows, CODEOWNERS and the PR template only at the REPOSITORY
#     root. In a subdirectory they are inert. `.github/workflows/scaffold-check.yml` is 332
#     lines that will never run, and it reads to any reviewer as though CI is enforcing the
#     standards. That is worse than having no workflow at all.
#   - `.claude/settings.json` walks `. */` — ONE level, deliberately (see the comment at the
#     hook installer). A project two levels down is invisible from the repository root, so
#     no hook ever fires for it.
#   - The adoption checklist says "AGENTS.md exists in repo root", which passes in the
#     project directory and quietly means something else there.
#
# Measured on a real adoption at `apps/<app>/` in a monorepo: all three were inert, nobody
# was told, and an outside reviewer found it. Before this, the string `monorepo` appeared in
# this repository exactly once — in a comment explaining why we stop at one level. We had
# identified the case, chosen the cheap thing, and told nobody.
#
# A NOTICE, NOT A REFUSAL. Adopting into a monorepo subdirectory is legitimate and common;
# it just needs different wiring, and the adopter has to know that before a reviewer tells
# them. `docs/ADOPTION_GUIDE.md` -> "Adopting inside a monorepo" says what to do.

# the scaffold secret rules, step 6 applies the overlay — destroyed every rule step 4 had

# erased `.localcoder-audit.jsonl*`, which this same script appends 400 lines above under a
# comment reading "the ordering is unforgiving". Reproduced end to end before the fix.
#

  # TREE SCANNERS — DISCOVERED, NOT LISTED, AND NOT REIMPLEMENTED HERE.
  #
  # This block used to carry its OWN copy of the secret-scan regex, and that copy was
  # scoped to `ai/` while tools/secret_scan.sh scans the whole tracked tree. So the two
  # answers to "are there secrets in this repo?" disagreed by construction, and the one a
  # human saw at the end of ./setup.sh was the narrower of the two — "a check aimed away
  # from the risk reads as coverage" (ai/MEMORY.md), with the added twist that the reading
  # was reassuring. Two copies of one rule is also how #96 reached one file and not the
  # other, twice.
  #
  # So there is now exactly one definition of each scan, in tools/, and this delegates.
  # New scanners are picked up with no edit here — the same discovery the CI workflow and
  # the selftest loop already use.
  #
  # AN ABSENT TOOL IS REPORTED AS "DID NOT RUN", NOT QUIETLY REPLACED BY A SMALLER CHECK.
  # Substituting a narrower inline scan is what created the divergence above. It stays
  # advisory rather than a hard failure: `./setup.sh` force-installs tools/, so absence
  # means someone deleted it deliberately, and failing their verification run over it
  # would be a guard that blocks legitimate work.

  # THE VENDORED CHECKS, RUN RATHER THAN ASSUMED — AND LOGGED INDIVIDUALLY.
  #
  # `setup.sh --check` logging once would say the wrapper ran and nothing about whether it
  # still runs each check INSIDE it. That distinction is not academic: until 0.9.0 this
  # function skipped header_check, localcoder_sync and the archive report entirely while
  # printing "all hard checks passed", and a per-run log would have recorded a healthy
  # `setup.sh --check` every single day throughout. The granularity of the log has to match
  # the granularity of the thing that can go missing.
  #
  # This function verified 4 things and printed "all hard checks passed", while CI ran 13.
  # header_check.sh, session_archive.py and localcoder_sync.py are all vendored, offline and
  # fast, and none of them was invoked — so a human running `./setup.sh --check` got a
  # materially narrower answer than the build, and the narrower one was the reassuring one.
  # That is the same divergence the secret scan already cost this file: two answers to "is
  # this scaffold OK", and the one a person reads was the smaller.

  # The load order in ai/STANDARDS.md names nine files, and every one of them is read in full
  # at session start. Nothing measured the total, and it grew the way an append-only file
  # always does. MEASURED 2026-09-01: 95 KB here (~24k tokens), 156 KB in Robiton/localcoder,
  # 184 KB in localcoder-dev and 217 KB in ai-project-scaffold-dev -- roughly 54k tokens, a
  # quarter of a 200k window spent before anybody has asked for anything.
  #
  # ADVISORY, AND THE DEFAULT IS SET WHERE IT IS NOT RED ON ARRIVAL. 80 KB was the number
  # asked for and it cannot be the default: a FRESH adoption -- template ai/ files and
  # nothing else -- measures 85 KB after this release's trim, so an 80 KB default would
  # redden every adopter on the day they adopt, which ai/SECURITY.md's own rule says is how
  # a check gets ignored. 120 KB is the product floor plus headroom. It still trips the
  # three repositories that needed to hear it: localcoder 151 KB, localcoder-dev 179 KB and
  # ai-project-scaffold-dev 211 KB, all measured 2026-09-01.
  #
  # 80 KB IS STILL THE TARGET, and the over-message says so, because the goal is to get the

  # failure the MEMORY.md ceiling section in ai/STANDARDS.md is entirely about.

# Create .claude/settings.json with SessionStart hook to auto-run sync-check.sh
# (settings.local.json is globally gitignored — settings.json is committed project config)
#
# THE HOOK LOOKS FOR THE REPO, IT DOES NOT ASSUME IT IS STANDING IN IT.
#
# `[ -f sync-check.sh ]` is relative to the session's WORKING DIRECTORY, which is only the
# repo root when someone opens the editor exactly there. Measured 2026-08-09 on this
# project's own machine: sessions run in the PARENT of three scaffold repos — the layout
# this project's own AGENTS.md prescribes, "open this repo plus ../ai-project-scaffold as a
# second working directory" — so the guard was false every time, `|| true` swallowed it, and
# **the session-start check had never run once**. Not degraded: never run. A hook whose
# every failure path is `|| true` cannot tell you it did nothing.
#
# So it scans the current directory and one level below, and runs in each place that is
# actually an adoption (`ai/STANDARDS.md` present — the same signal every other check keys
# on). In an ordinary single-repo session `.` matches and nothing else does. In a
# multi-repo session every repo gets checked, which is the behaviour that was intended all
# along. One level only: deeper is a monorepo, and walking it at session start is a cost
# nobody asked for.
# MERGE, NEVER SKIP. This block used to do two wrong things and they had the same cause:
# a SECOND copy of the hooks lived here, in a heredoc, and the real set lived in
# .claude/settings.json. The copy drifted to ONE of SIX commands, so a project created
# without an existing settings.json lost the session journal, correction capture,
# SessionEnd and both PreCompact hooks (#246 and the drift found alongside it). And when a
# settings.json DID exist -- the normal state of any repo where someone has already run
# Claude Code, which is exactly the adoption population -- the whole file was skipped and
# the adopter got no hooks at all.
#
# So: .claude/settings.hooks.json is now the single source of truth, and this merges it.
# The scaffold owns the `hooks` key. The adopter owns every sibling key -- permissions,
# env, model, statusLine -- and they are preserved untouched. That is what a person
# reconciling the two files by hand would do.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------- THIS IS NOT THE SCAFFOLD
# A NEW PROJECT IS CREATED BY CLONING THIS REPOSITORY — docs/QUICK_START.md step 1 says so —
# which means it arrives carrying the scaffold's OWN repo artifacts. Three of them are the
# exact signals `is_upstream_repo()` keys on, so until they go, every tool in here classifies
# the adopter's project as THE SCAFFOLD ITSELF.
#
# MEASURED END TO END ON 2026-08-12, from the published 0.37.1 tarball. A new project set up
# by the documented path, which then did the very first thing AGENTS.md instructs — write a
# dated ai/SESSION.md entry — and ran `tools/preflight.sh` as instructed:
#
#   [FAIL] shipped ai/ files are templates, not our session log
#   [FAIL] localcoder context budget  (exit 1)
#
# Their session log is failing the build for containing session entries, and this
# repository's 28-line prose ratchet is being enforced on their project. BOTH of those were
# scoped to upstream-only on 2026-08-11 precisely so they could not do this to an adopter —
# and the scoping works. It keys on a predicate that a cloned scaffold satisfies.
#
# `tools/adoption_check.sh` did not catch it because it builds the OTHER downstream shape:
# an existing project that took the scaffold by docs/ADOPTION_GUIDE.md and therefore never
# had these files. Two onboarding paths, one covered.
#
# .github/CODEOWNERS IS NOT PART OF THE PREDICATE AND IS REMOVED ANYWAY: it reads `* @Robiton`,
# so every pull request in the adopter's own repository would request review from us.
#
# NOT ON --upgrade AND NOT ON --check. An existing adopter has none of these to remove, and
# the upgrader never installs them.

# 2026-08-15 the moment preflight stopped printing PASSED over a failing must-run gate: the
# new-project fixture, built by tarring the localcoder repo, failed its own preflight on
# `tests/audit_localcoder.sh`.
#

# legitimately, and silently retiring that declaration would be the worst thing in this file:
# a gate the repository said it cannot go green without, gone, with the verdict still green.
# `--name` is only supplied when someone is naming a NEW project, so the source's declarations
# are by definition not theirs. `--upgrade` and `--check` never reach here at all.
